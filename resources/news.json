    "body": "Snapdragon Satellite Demo site in Nevada TIRIAS Research There's been an increasing interest in satellite communications with standard smartphones, largely to cover exceptional situations and emergencies where there is insufficient or no cellular service. Recently, Apple offered an emergency SOS text service for iPhone 14, SpaceX and T-Mobile announced plans to add satellite connectivity in 2023, and Google has stated that they will add satellite support in Android 14 later in 2023. At CES 2023, Qualcomm announced its world-wide (subject to local laws) satellite service for premium smartphones in the second half of 2023 utilizing the Iridium satellite constellation. The Qualcomm/Iridium service will be called Snapdragon Satellite and will offer full two-way texts, not just emergency messages. But no voice, image, or streaming services are available at this point. Qualcomm is also partnering with Garmin to provide the support for emergency messaging. Qualcomms use of the low-earth orbit Iridium satellites operating in the L band allows the use of the standard X70 and future smartphone modems, including the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 smartphone processor. Iridium satellites have polar orbits, so the coverage is from pole to pole. One of the advantages of the Iridium satellite network is that messages can be forwarded from satellite to satellite until an appropriate ground station downlink (\"feeder link\") is found. The text message packet also includes location information for emergency services. A Snapdragon Satellite-capable smartphone does require a specific antenna and support for the satellite connection L-band radio, but no special external antenna is required. That said, the user must position the phone to find the best satellite. To demonstrate the new service, Qualcomm took a group of press and analysts to a dry lakebed about 40 minutes outside of the Las Vegas strip in order to set the right background for such a service. Ironically, while the location looked remote, it had great 5G coverage! The demonstration involved a prototype phone running a beta of the satellite app. With the prototype, Qualcomm executive Francesco Grilli located an Iridium connection and sent a message to his personal phone. Qualcomm VP Francesco Grilli demonstrating the satellite location app on a Nevada dry lakebed TIRIAS Research Theres One Main Reason Ukraine Might Prefer German Tanks Over U.S. TanksThe American Vehicles Guzzle Fuel There are plenty of remote locations with limited or no cellular coverage like the middle of an ocean, remote mountains, deserts, etc. that would welcome additional service without needing a specialized satellite phone. The Snapdragon Satellite service will be used for a variety of purposes such as emergencies or recreational adventuring in remote, rural, and offshore locations. I expect that smartphones offering Snapdragon Satellite will be marketed to adventurers, sailors, and remote hikers, as well as for specialized workers in remote locations. Garmin will add Snapdragon Satellite to its Garmin Response service that already supports thousands of SOS incidents each year. In addition, there will also be Snapdragon Satellite applications beyond smartphones to support other devices needing global messaging capabilities including laptops, tablets, vehicles, and IoT. Qualcomm plans to grow the Snapdragon Satellite ecosystem, with additional OEMs and app developers. Plans are to support 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), as NTN satellite infrastructure and constellations become available. Qualcomm said that emergency messaging on Snapdragon Satellite is planned to be available on next-generation smartphones based on the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform and will launch in select regions starting in the second half of 2023. Qualcomm intends to be the service provider for the service, but its not clear how this will work in the wireless carriers. No pricing was announced.

    "description": "#1-Ranked Industry Analyst Patrick Moorhead gives his coverage of Qualcomm and its Snapdragon Ride Flex family of SoCs at CES 2023.",
    "body": "Qualcomms concept car at CES 2023. Patrick Moorhead The automotive booths are some of the most mind-blowing displays at CES. In my podcast, The Six Five, my co-host Daniel Newman of Futurum Research and I focused our coverage of CES 2023 almost exclusively on automotive tech, talking with Qualcomm, Luminar, Volvo, Mercedes, and Polestar. At the event, Qualcomm showcased its Snapdragon Digital Chassis, allowing us to see the entire chassis come together in one of the best concepts at CES 2023. While Qualcomm also announced new Snapdragon Satellite technology at the event, here I want to cover Qualcomm's momentum with the Snapdragon Ride platform and especially its Snapdragon Ride Flex family of system-on-chips (SoC) devices. I have written extensively on Qualcomm's Digital Chassis and how much of Qualcomm's automotive plays fit directly into its existing markets. Last autumn, I touched on this in my coverage of Qualcomm's first Automotive Investor Day in New York City, and then in another piece explained how Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm Automotive, was that show's star. On top of the organic growth it has created, Qualcomm also has a long list of automotive partners, including Stellantis and two huge wins in the automotive market. Global momentum At CES, Qualcomm highlighted how automotive companies are rapidly developing safe and updateable advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving (AD) solutions on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride platform. Qualcomm highlighted three strengths of the platform that enable accelerated adoption and rapid development for Tier 1 suppliers. MORE FOR YOU Twitter Bird Statue Sells For $100,000 As Musk Auctions Off Old Company Mementos First, Qualcomm talked about safety and how the company is working closely with automotive safety experts across the automotive ecosystem. The most compelling incentive behind ADAS and AD solutions comes from the safety outcomes of fully autonomous roads and highways. When the roads are filled with safe autonomous vehicles, there is less chance for human unpredictability, human carelessness and human-caused accidents. Qualcomm fully understands the need to work with safety experts across the automotive ecosystem, and I believe the close relations it has built with automotive partners allow Qualcomm to meet the highest safety standards. The inside of Qualcomms concept car at CES 2023. Patrick Moorhead Second, with the foundation of safety standards in place, Qualcomm is able to offer customizable and configurable designs for its partners. Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon Ride platform is engineered to allow for customization opportunities; it can adapt to evolving automotive architectures and be augmented by dedicated AI accelerators to support the ADAS/AD operational design domain (ODD). The automotive sector is a mature industry with many years of established IP. Qualcomm's offerings would be difficult to adopt if already-established solutions were not adaptable to future Snapdragon technologiesso the company has taken the steps needed to ensure that adaptability. Third, Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride Platform is scalable. Qualcomm has a one-technology roadmap that allows it to scale its computing, connectivity and other technologies into other markets. The same technology that is in its smartphone solutions is in its automotive solutions, and it is scaled to support Qualcomm's software-defined vehicle strategy. The Snapdragon Cockpit Platform and the Snapdragon Ride Platform in Qualcomms concept car at CES ... [+] Patrick Moorhead Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC At CES 2023, Qualcomm provided more information of a new family of SoCs, which it refers to as the first scalable family of SoCs to support digital cockpit and advanced driver assistance systems. The Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC is designed to offer an all-in-one package where both the ADAS compute platform and the digital cockpit compute platform are on the same hardware. As it scales from L1 to L5, brands and Tier 1s can leverage the investment made across their entire portfolio of investments. I believe this integration of the ADAS/AD platform and the digital cockpit could benefit Qualcomm's automotive partners by simplifying hardware and software considerations onto a single SoC platform. The partners can then focus on a unified compute platform and software-defined vehicle architecture. It should allow automakers to leverage its compute investment across a portfolio of cars. This unified experience could offer better efficiency within the vehicle and allow automakers to offer better-defined multi-tier experiences through over-the-air (OTA) updates for potential upgrades. Snapdragon Ride Flex stack. Patrick Moorhead I also believe the Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC could bring Qualcomm more partner wins with its all-in-one design. While this is not Qualcomm's first automotive SoC, it is the first fully aggregated SoC for vehicles. And its one that has high-performance for areas where it appeared NVIDIA was the only solution. OTAs can also be bundled for the digital cockpit and ADAS/AD platforms rather than separated, allowing for more intentional use of OTAs. Wrapping up Qualcomm showcased one of the nicest concept cars I have ever seen in my twenty years of attending CES. What shocked me the most was that the car is actually drivable and street-ready. With an immersive digital cockpit experience, suicide doors and the complete Snapdragon Ride and Snapdragon Cockpit platforms, this car makes me excited to see future cars with these types of innovative technologies. Qualcomm's newest Snapdragon Ride Flex family of SoCs also displayed an innovative Qualcomm first with its unified ADAS/AD solution and digital cockpit platform. It brings a range of benefits to its automotive partners, including simplifying the logistics of the hardware and software and enabling the car to interact more effectively with its different critical workloads. Qualcomm is continuing to consolidate and unify its automotive platforms, furthering its momentum into 2023. Note: Moor Insights & Strategy co-op Jacob Freyman contributed to this article.

    "body": "Lidar companies face a make it or break it year By Bernice Clark on January 18, 2023 That nagging deja vu feeling kept creeping in earlier this month during CES 2023 in Las Vegas. At every turn, in the newly constructed West Hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center, and even amid the crowded startup grinder at Eureka Park, was a company pitching lidar sensor technology. That might not have been so remarkable in 2017 or 2018. But its 2023. The peak of the hype cycle, when hundreds of millions of dollars were thrown into lidar startups, is a distant glint in the rearview mirror. The industry went through the business model pivot phase and rode the special purpose acquisition mergers wave in a pursuit of capital that public markets can provide. How could so many of these lidar sensor companies nearly two dozen by my count still be hanging on (and spending considerable money to exhibit at CES) after a boom-and-bust cycle that led to a widespread culling? Lidar, the light detection and ranging radar that measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world, is considered a critical sensor to support autonomous vehicles, and increasingly advanced driver assistance systems. As the optimism and gravitas surrounding autonomous vehicles reached new, dizzying heights, lidar was swept up in investment chaos. Between 65 to 70 companies with active lidar programs existed in 2018, according to industry estimates. As the timelines around the deployment of autonomous vehicles slipped, consolidation seemed inevitable. And it was. Dozens of lidar companies have folded or been swallowed up by another competitor in the past four years. Consolidation was already underway by 2019. It has only ramped up since. And that seek-capital-in-public-markets plan that took off in 2020 hasnt been as fruitful as some hoped, due to the cost of development and that potentially inflated valuations were based on projected revenue, not actual revenue. Of the nine companies that went public via SPAC mergers a list that includes Aeye, Aeva, Cepton, Luminar, Innoviz, Ouster and Velodyne there has been at least one bankruptcy and a merger. Quanergy filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2022 about 10 months after going public through a merger with a SPAC. Ouster, a SPAC that acquired Sense Photonics in 2021, agreed to merge with Velodyne in November 2022 in an all-stock transaction. Lidar company Luminar said its able to verify 25 companies with active lidar programs, a figure in line with other estimates in the industry. Lidar sensors and GPS antennas are displayed on a fully autonomous Caterpillar Inc. 777 mining haul truck at the companys booth during CES. So where does that leave the industry today? Walking the floor of CES 2023 one might mistakenly assume that business is booming enough to sustain two dozen companies. Its not. Snow Bull Capital CEO Taylor Ogan expects many lidar companies will be sifted out this year and the make it or break it year for those that remain will be 2024. I think we will see the big OEMs make lidar commitments in 2023, Ogan said, adding that a lot of models will be unveiled with lidar. But 2024 will be the make-or-break year for lidar companies, where we will see whose fancy booths at CES were just that, and who is actually going to deliver. Today, about of 80% of lidar companies actually putting sensors in cars today are in Asia, according to Ogan. China-based companies Hesai, Robosense and Livox all have design wins with automakers and have shipped sensors for production models in 2022. Hesai is at the top of the lidar sensor producer heap. The company has shipped more than 103,000 lidar units from 2017 to December 31, 2022, according to a recent securities filing. However, the bulk of that production occurred in 2022 when it made and shipped more than 80,000 sensors. Of those, 62,000 Hesai units have gone to Chinese automakers including Li Auto, Jidu and Lotus to support advanced driver assistance systems. The remainder were used in other applications such as robotaxis, agriculture, mining, mapping and smart infrastructure. The pace of Hesais production is expected to ramp up this year. The company is opening a third factory in Shanghai this year with a capacity to produce 1 million units a year. There are also handful U.S.-based companies that are producing and selling lidar sensors for robotics and industrial applications. And when it comes to U.S. lidar companies shipping sensors to production vehicles, that list gets even smaller. Perhaps one of the buzziest companies is Luminar, a startup-turned-publicly traded company, that has operations in Florida and Silicon Valley. Luminar has started producing and shipping its Iris lidar sensors to SAIC Motor to support ADAS in the Chinese automakers new electric SUV, the Rising Auto R7. Its sensors are also headed to Volvos new electric EX90 SUV and the upcoming Polestar 3 SUV. A Luminar lidar integrated in a Volvo. Image Credits: Volvo Luminar struck a deal in 2020 with Mobileye to supply the company with lidar for its robotaxi fleet. It has also landed contracts with Nissan and Mercedes. Based on its internal estimates, the company expects that by the second half of the decade (so after 2025) there will be more than 1 million Luminar-equipped vehicles out on the road, founder and CEO Austin Russell reiterated on stage at CES 2023. Theres also Innovusion, a Silicon Valley based company with operations in Suzhou, China, that supplies Chinese automaker Nio with sensors. While leadership positions can shift, industry experts still expect the field of lidar companies will continue to shrink. The lidar industry will directionally start to look like the millimeter wave radar industry, Mike Ramsey, vp analyst of automotive and smart mobility at Gartner. Today, there are about seven or eight companies such as Aptiv, Bosch, Continental and ZF that supply automakers with millimeter wave radar. I cant see why lidar for auto would be different, Ramsey said. He did add that lidar has more applications outside of auto, which may support a few additional companies. source: TechCrunch",

Readers like you help support XDA Developers. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More. The HP Dragonfly G4, announced at CES 2023, is shaping up to be one of the hottest business laptops of the year. This fourth-generation version has ditched the \"Elite\" branding but is still the successor to the HP Elite Dragonfly G3, one of our top picks when it comes to the best business laptops you can buy today. The Dragonfly G4 hasn't changed a much physically, going forward with the redesigned look that the G3 model received just last year. HP has instead focused on boosting performance with Intel's latest 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors, on boosting conferencing with new camera technologies, and on boosting battery life with intelligent power-saving additions. Let's take a look at exactly how the new HP Dragonfly G4 and the Elite Dragonfly G3 compare to help you decide whether it's worth the upgrade. Source: HP HP Dragonfly G4 HP's Dragonfly G4 brings new 13th Gen Intel Core CPUs, new collaboration tools, and better power management compared to the Elite Dragonfly G3. It's expected to launch Spring 2023 and might be worth the upgrade for those who often collaborate online. See at HP See at Amazon Price, availability, and specs The new HP Dragonfly G4 was announced recently at CES 2023 and so far doesn't have a firm starting price. We do know that it's expected to launch Spring 2023. The older HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is still readily available at HP's official website, as well as some third-party retailers like Amazon. If you're shopping straight from HP, prices start at about $1,839 before any discounts. The introductory models have a 12th Gen Intel Core i5-1235U processor (CPU), 16GB of RAM, 256GB solid-state drive (SSD), and a 13.5-inch FHD+ touch display. Going all-out with a Core i7-1265U vPro CPU, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, 3K2K OLED display, and 5G connectivity costs about $4,000. Here's a look at the specifications available in each laptop. HP Dragonfly G4 Design and features HP Dragonfly G4 The Elite Dragonfly G3 is a big step away from the first two generations in terms of design. In fact, it was pretty much completely redesigned as a clamshell form factor that starts out weighing about 2.2 pounds (.999kg). This is made possible by a blend of magnesium and aluminum that's both durable and lightweight. The Elite Dragonfly G3 is available in Slate Blue and Natural Silver colors to give a bit of variety, though it seems like HP is only regularly offering the former color. The Dragonfly G4 uses the same design with the same weight and dimensions, and it will be available in Slate Blue and Natural Silver colors. Chassis edges are slightly rounded for a more comfortable hold, and overall the laptops are quite nimble. If you often travel, either generation will be a great fit. Ports haven't changed for the new generation, and you're still getting a generous mix that will handle most daily connections. The laptops have two Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0, 3.5mm audio, and an optional Nano SIM slot if you opt for 5G (which is available in both laptops). There are unfortunately no microSD or SD card readers on board, but you can always add one of the best Thunderbolt docks for the Dragonfly G3 to further broaden your connectivity. That will cover any of the best accessories for the Elite Dragonfly G3. HP hasn't changed the keyboard for the Dragonfly G4, and that's a good thing. In our HP Elite Dragonfly G3 review, Senior Editor Joo Carrasqueira noted that \"the keyboard is one of the best in a laptop.\" It's backlit, the keys are spaced well, the keycaps are large with an oversized font, and actuation force is perfect. If you're typing a lot every day, either one of these laptops will be a great choice. Even the Precision touchpad is enormous for easier pointing and shortcut gestures. HP Elite Dragonfly G3 The Elite Dragonfly G3's 5MP camera offers separated RGB and IR portions for a better picture. It's one of the best webcams in a laptop today, boosted by included software that can automatically frame you in the center of the picture, boost a dark room's lighting, blur your background, and filter out blemishes for an all-around smoother appearance. The Dragonfly G4 holds onto all of these features but also adds HP's new Natural Tone feature that makes skin look more like it does in real life. Also new to the Dragonfly G4 is multi-camera support to help with professional conferencing. With an extra camera on-hand, you can essentially have a second stream of, say, a document, whiteboard, or object sitting on a desk. HP's Auto Camera Select recognizes where you are and keeps you centered, while HP Keystone Correction can automatically adjust the other camera's feed to display a cropped and flat picture of a document or whiteboard. If you often find yourself presenting over the internet, these new camera features might sway you toward the newer model. Security is excellent in both laptops. Along with the IR camera and fingerprint reader for biometric logins through Windows Hello, the camera's shutter adds some extra privacy. HP's Wolf Security package with extra malware and virus protection is available, and each laptop comes with a bevy of HP's security solutions like HP Sure Sense, HP Sure Start, HP Sure Admin, HP Sure Run, HP Sure Recover, and HP Tamper Lock. These laptops are made for professionals and have the security to keep your data safe. Display HP Dragonfly G4 Nothing has really changed between generations when it comes to the available displays, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Both laptops have a 13.5-inch screen with a tall 3:2 aspect ratio for more display real estate, and both have a bunch of different options to better suit your needs. The most affordable have a 1920x1280 resolution, 400 nits brightness, optional touch, and optional anti-glare finish. One step are the HP Sure View Reflect screens that add a privacy layer perfect for those often working in public. These screens hit 1,000 nits brightness to offset the privacy layer, and touch is an option. Finally, the 3000x2000 displays use an OLED panel for the best color and contrast possible. They're touch-enabled and hit 400 nits brightness. You should be able to get something that works for you. The FHD+ displays will offer better battery life, the Sure View privacy screens are great for keeping your data safe, and the OLED 3K2K screen is there if you want the extra pixels, color, and contrast. Performance and battery HP Elite Dragonfly G3 The Elite Dragonfly G3's combination of 12th Gen Intel Core U-series CPUs, LPDDR5-6400MHz RAM, and M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD is quite potent, and you should have no problems cutting through a day of business productivity work. Yes, P-series",

The satellite passes by very quickly, and during this time, you have to photograph it in the center of the image and in several different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to learn details about it.&rdquo;VEN&micro;S satellite (credit: ISRAEL AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES)In addition to regular optical communication, which uses lasers or LEDs of different wavelengths, the new ground station will also enable the conduction of experiments in quantum optical communication. Advanced communications use the quantum properties of individual photons to transmit encrypted information.&ldquo;Theoretically speaking, quantum communication is completely encrypted,&rdquo; Oz said. &ldquo;It is impossible to launch a cyberattack and copy the information because in quantum mechanics, there is a principle that prevents copying. As soon as a third party tries to intercept a message, they destroy the original signal, for example, by changing the polarization of the photons, and both communicating parties will know that someone tried to listen in on them. That&rsquo;s how it works in theory. In practice, there are quite a few research questions that need to be answered.&rdquo;For example, he said, &ldquo;what do we do with interference in a signal that is not created as a result of attempted eavesdropping, but rather, for example, from the weather? Should we use qubits [quantum bits, the counterpart in quantum computing to the binary digit or bit of classical computing] or qudits [photons that have more than two states]? And more generally, how much information can be transmitted this way within the limited transmission time in which the satellite passes over the ground station?&rdquo; The list of unanswered questions is long. Quantum communication is a completely experimental field. There are protocols from experiments conducted in labs, but the only country that has successfully demonstrated such communication is China, which did so in 2016.The Americans also apparently succeeded in this, but they published nothing about it in scientific journals. Apart from these two superpowers, a few countries, including Germany, Singapore and now Israel, are preparing to demonstrate this capability.What are the phases?In the first phase of the project, the TAU researchers will try to establish optical communication followed by quantum communication between ground stations, between ground stations and drones and then between ground stations and a satellite of one of their international partners. Within two to three years, the researchers hope to raise the funds to build a dedicated &ldquo;blue-and-white&rdquo; quantum satellite.&ldquo;We are employing the &lsquo;tower and stockade&rsquo; method,&rdquo; Oz said. &ldquo;In the beginning, we will place a transmitter on the roof of the second building of the School of Physics in an attempt to produce an immune quantum key with a rate of hundreds to thousands of bits per second, with the aim of learning and improving the positioning, switching and synchronization capabilities of the light sources and the single-photon detectors.&ldquo;Later, we would like to reduce the size of the transmission system and integrate it into an airborne system, initially with drones, and establish a network of quantum communications. Ultimately, we would also like to launch our own satellite, which will try to establish quantum communication with the ground station and with a similar satellite in Singapore.&rdquo;",

    "description": "In an interview, Samsungs TM Roh explained why the Galaxy S23 lineup missed out on satellite communication capabilities but hinted the feature could still appear in future phones.",
    "body": "Samsung Unpacked came and went and the rumored feature was nowhere to be found. When there is the right timing, infrastructure and the technology [is] ready, then of course for Samsung Galaxy, for our mobile division, we would also actively consider adopting this feature as well. TM Roh (via translator) CNET (opens in new tab) reported that in a pre-Unpacked interview, Samsungs President of Mobile Experience TM Roh acknowledged the lack of satellite connectivity on the new flagship Samsung Phones and understood why people would want such a feature. However, he simply thinks it's too soon for Samsung to adopt the feature given its limited functionality. Samsung sans satellite: Why would the Galaxy S23 skip the feature? Roh isnt wrong about the limits of satellite connectivity at this stage. When Apple announced Emergency SOS via satellite , it stressed that complications that can arise. While its satellite connectivity safety feature can work in as little as 15 seconds, heavy foliage and obstructions can render the feature completely unusable. You truly need an unobstructed line of site with a satellite for it to work at this time. This isnt to say that Roh is opposed to adding the feature to future Samsung phones. In his words (via translator) When there is the right timing, infrastructure and the technology [is] ready, then of course for Samsung Galaxy, for our mobile division, we would also actively consider adopting this feature as well. (Image credit: Qualcomm) That thinking tracks with a comment provided to us by satellite expert Peter Kibutu, Advanced Technology Lead for Non-Terrestrial Networks at TTP (opens in new tab) . Kibutu thinks that Samsung is, likely biding its time as the industry catches up with standardisation. One such standard Kibutu thinks Samsung is waiting on is 3GPP standards, which, will eventually enable handsets to roam between multiple satellite providers and deliver ubiquitous high-performance connectivity beyond emergency services. Given that currently, companies like Apple need to build out their own satellite networks, usually through third-party partners, Samsung waiting for standards to allow a phone to pick up any  or most  satellites before rolling out its own satellite communication features. If Samsung wants to roll out the ability to make certain communications via satellite on its new phones, they may not need to work on it alone. Qualcomm, who just provided a bespoke Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for the entire S23 lineup, is working on its own version of Emergency SOS via satellite. Qualcomm announced a partnership with the Iridium satellite network and Garmin Response emergency rescue services at CES 2023 to offer emergency communications via satellite on Android phones later this year through a Snapdragon Satellite app. The feature is expected to roll out on Snapdragon 8 Gen 2-powered devices in North America and Europe. It is expected to start as a two-way emergency messaging service, but Qualcomm eventually wants to expand to sending regular texts and other messages in remote areas where cellular service is not available.

    "body": "Overview: Picture day Smile. You're on camera (in space). Recently the spotlight turned to an increasingly lucrative sector of the space industry  satellite imagery  thanks to space-focused research and investment firm Quilty Analytics. The market for space pictures matured in the past decade, with expanded use in conflict hot spots, infrastructure and supply chains, to name a few. I chatted this week with Quilty's Director of Research Caleb Henry, who authored a report for the firm on \"Very High Resolution\" imagery. If you ask Henry, though, the \"V\" in \"VHR\" could stand for Valuable. \"The sharper it is, the shinier it is,\" he told me. For a bit of background: The quality of a satellite image is defined by how much a pixel represents the Earth's surface. So a resolution of 30 centimeters means that each pixel equals a distance of 30 centimeters on the ground. Quilty's report broke the satellite imagery market into four categories ranging from VHR, at 50 centimeters or sharper, to Low Resolution, at 5 meters or more. There were just 11 commercial VHR satellites in orbit as of 2022, operated by a handful of companies. Quilty projects that number will jump past 100 by 2027. But while demand has grown steadily, the report warns that the incoming supply is poised to outpace need. \"A lot of the growth projections that have been put out there for satellite imagery, including VHR, are inflated  especially when you look at historical norms,\" Henry cautioned. Satellite imagery \"struggled to prove itself for years\" as a sector in the space industry, Henry said. \"Now that it has proved that it can exist, the next thing it needs to prove is that it can thrive.\" What's up First NASA astronauts who flew with SpaceX receive rare award: Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House.

The orbital debris dots are scaled according to the image size of the graphic to optimize their visibility and are not scaled to Earth. (Courtesy: NASA ODPO) A \"worst-case scenario\" was thwarted on Friday when two large pieces of space debris narrowly missed each other, according to LeoLabs LeoLabs said the debris included the defunct satellite Cosmos 2361 and an SL-8 rocket body, which are two of countless pieces of space debris currently in low-Earth orbit. According to NASA , objects in low-Earth orbit (or LEO) involve objects orbiting our planet at an altitude of 1,200 miles (2,000 km) or less. On Friday, Cosmos 2381 and the SL-8 rocket body nearly collided at an altitude of about 611 miles (984 km). An image showing how two large, defunct objects in LEO narrowly missed each other on January 27, 2023. Each line represents the paths of an SL-8 rocket body (16511) and a Cosmos 2361 (25590) satellite. (LeoLabs / https://leolabs.space / FOX Weather) LeoLabs determined that the two pieces of space debris missed each other by about 20 feet (6 meters), with an error margin of only a few tens of meters. \"We've identified this kind of collision  between two massive derelict objects  as a worst-case scenario because it's largely out of our control and would likely result in a ripple effect of dangerous collisional encounters,\" LeoLabs said in a tweet . They said that had the Cosmos 2381 and SL-8 rocket body smashed into each other, the collision would have resulted in thousands of new debris fragments that would remain for decades. NASA's DART spacecraft slams into target asteroid in defense test The galactic slam occurred at a harmless asteroid 7 million miles (9.6 million kilometers) away, with the spacecraft named DART plowing into the space rock at 14,000 mph (22,500 kph). Scientists expected the impact to carve out a crater, hurl streams of rocks and dirt into space and, most importantly, alter the asteroids orbit. This near-collision is significant because it illustrates how much space debris is floating around in low-Earth orbit. According to LeoLabs, a layer of the LEO thats only about 62 miles thick contains an estimated 160 SL-8 rocket bodies, along with their 160 payloads, that were deployed over 20 years ago. WHY SPACE TRASH WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT This \"bad neighborhood\" in the LEO, said LeoLabs, is located between altitudes of 950 and 1050 km and continues to be a hotspot for debris collisions. Astronaut Randy Bresnik participates in a spacewalk outside of the International Space Station. The ISS lies within the low-Earth orbit. (NASA) These collisions and near-collisions in LEO remain top of mind for many. Because in addition to being populated with defunct space debris, the LEO region is also considered an area near enough to Earth",

Dr. Dave Golan discovered a man-made design on the side of a mountain near where he lives in the Mountain's Edge neighborhood in southwest Las Vegas. (Bizuayehu Tesfaye Las Vegas Review-Journal) @btesfaye A mysterious artwork on a plateau overlooking Las Vegas appears to have started emerging in 2017, according to historical satellite photos from Google Earth Pro. The work of land art, which depicts a large triangle with a face on one corner and a yin and yang symbol at the other, was recently spotted by Dave Golan, 60, a Las Vegas doctor who lives nearby and walks his dogs up to the plateau, which is just west of South Fort Apache Road and West Cactus Avenue, where the Mountains Edge neighborhood ends and the desert begins. And the piece apparently keeps evolving. When Review-Journal photographer Bizuayehu Tesfaye shot the image below with his drone on Jan. 19, the face was clearly smiling: Rocks arranged by an unknown person in the shape of a large triangle with a yin yang at one point and a face at the other are seen, on Thursday, Jan. 19, 2023, in Las Vegas. Dr. Dave Golan discovered a man-made design on the side of a mountain near where he lives in the Mountain's Edge neighborhood in southwest Las Vegas. (Bizuayehu Tesfaye Las Vegas Review-Journal) @btesfaye That happy face is a contrast to the most recent available satellite image on Google Maps, which is dated 2023 and shows a frown on the face. Even if that satellite image wasnt actually captured in 2023, satellite imagery from April 2022 (see below) also shows a frown. This satellite image from Google Maps, which is dated 2023, shows a frown on the face. After the Review-Journal published a story and photos of the work of art, several readers emailed their theories and tips about the piece. Anjaneyulu Yarlagadda, 36, of Las Vegas, sent a Twitter direct message to say the face looks like Lord Hanuman, a figure from Hindu mythology, who, according to brittanica.com, was the the monkey commander of the monkey army. His exploits are narrated in the great Hindu Sanskrit poem the Ramayana (Ramas Journey). Another reader emailed to say the face looked like that of the Monkey King, the main character in the popular Chinese children novel The Journey to the West. The image, which was created when somebody or even a group of people rearranged the rocks on the plateau, is hard to see when youre standing right in front of it. The rearranged rocks, each of which is pretty heavy and also jagged, blend in with all the many other rocks scattered about the plateau. It hides in plain sight. Dr. Dave Golan poses for a photo with his dogs on Thursday, Jan. 19, 2023, where he discovered rocks arranged by an unknown person near where he lives in the Mountain's Edge neighborhood in southwest Las Vegas. (Bizuayehu Tesfaye Las Vegas Review-Journal) @btesfaye Golan, a former trauma physician at University Medical Center who now operates clinics in Las Vegas, was looking down at the plateau from a higher ledge on the hill at sunset in early January when he noticed that some of the rocks there appeared to be positioned in an intentional design. He went home and checked the satellite imagery on Google Maps. And there it was: the face, the symbol and the triangle. The triangles sides are each over 50 feet in length. But who did it? And how long has it been there? To the question of who created the piece, thats still unknown. The query of how long its been there, that has become more clear, thanks again to Google and two readers, Brent Ozar, 49, a small-business owner who lives in Henderson, and Richard Kimmell, 62, a commercial property manager who lives in Las Vegas. Both Ozar and Kimmell emailed the Review-Journal to say that the evolution of the piece from its inception can be seen in historical satellite images that can be viewed on Google Earth Pro, which allows a viewer to see the historical satellite imagery for a given location. Looking at the satellite images of the plateau, it appears the piece was started in 2017. We can deduce this by looking at this satellite image from March 2016. There is nothing there: In March 2016, there is nothing there. (Google Earth Pro) Then, by May 2017, a circle has emerged: In May 2017, a circle has appeared. This is the first sign of the artwork. (Google Earth Pro) In November 2017, and bear with us because its hard to see in this image, there is a circle and to the lower left of that, what appears to be a Star of David: In this Google Earth Pro satellite image from November 2017, a circle and Star of David are visible on the plateau. (Google Earth Pro) Golan said in a text message that the visible progression of the artwork lends itself to more questions than answers. It adds to the mystery knowing that the artist didnt start with a set plan, Golan said. What made them decide to scrap the star? Who is the face? Why did they turn frown upside down? I dont know. What I really want to known is if they have created any others elsewhere in the desert. By May 2019, the artwork was looking pretty close to what it looks like now: The triangle with the face and yin and yang symbol are there in May 2019. (Google Earth Pro) It also looks pretty much the same in February 2020: The triangle with the face and the yin and yang symbol are visible in this image from February 2020. (Google Earth Pro) And April 2022: This image from April 2022 shows the artwork mostly as it appears today. However, the face is frowning, which contrasts with drone images shot by Las Vegas Review-Journal photographer Bizu Tesfaye on Jan. 19, 2023. In those images captured by Tesfaye, the face is smiling. (Google Earth Pro) Finally, the artwork is laid out on land that is owned by the federal Bureau of Land Management. A spokesperson said that the first time the bureau had heard about the existence of the artwork was when the Review-Journal reached out for comment and to ask if the bureau knew who created the art. Kirsten Cannon, a spokesperson for BLMs Southern Nevada District, said that while land art pieces can be an important addition to BLM lands, permits need to be issued when such art is created so that details can be work",

Image Credits: Unsplash The latest colony, which is home to nearly 500 birds, was found at Verleger Point in west Antarctica using photos from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission of the European Commission. It was later confirmed with high-resolution photographs from the Maxar WorldView-3 satellite. , who led the research, called it an exciting discovery but also concerningly added that the colony was small and in a region severely affected by recent sea ice loss. How is climate change affecting the Emperor penguins? Climate change has caused the sea ice to rapidly melt, pushing these incredible ice birds towards an existential crisis. Penguins are especially vulnerable to pexels The fast ice in Antarctica has dramatically changed at a massive speed since 2015. The changing sea ice has already caused the loss of many colonies, including the Marguerite Bay colony, which had been studied since the 1940s, and the Halley Bay colony, which had been stable for 50 years. Their survival also directly depends on the population size in a colony, as these double-coated birds huddle together for warmth and protection against winter storms, especially during the two-month period when the male penguins incubate the eggs before they hatch. As per Fretwell, the sea ice conditions are degrading with each passing year due to global warming . As a result, ninety per cent of the known colonies will be lost by the end of the century if nothing is done to cut down the greenhouse gas emissions. Most emperor penguins will never see a human in their lifetime, but human actions on the other side of the world are slowly killing them. Curbing global warming is the only significant solution to save the world from losing these magnificent creatures. To 'science-up' your feed, follow us on ",

The SBAS are used to enhance the accuracy and precision of an existing GPS system. GPS by itself isnt sufficiently accurate to do things like help land airplanes or other applications where there is a need for high accuracy combined with high consequences for failure. Simply put, it means using satellite systems for air navigation. The airlines are also able to save costs through fuel burns as the system has the capability of reducing flight time on some routes within Nigeria by up to 5-7 minutes. The Managing Director of NAMA, Mr Lawrence Matthew Pwajok said: When an airline tells you their fuel consumption, you will understand and you multiply that by five or seven minutes, you will know how much it is. We also have the calculation which we can make available to you for different airline categories in fuel savings, time savings, and Co2 emission savings, which is very critical. What we have implemented at the moment that we have done in 32 airports, including military airports and private and state government and federal airports, is what we call performancebased navigation. It provides you with large guidance for you to improve on the accuracy, integrity, and availability of the signal.

    "description": "Samsungs S23 phones dont have the ability to contact people via satellite in emergencies, something the iPhone can do and Qualcomm is promising to bring to Android phones this year.",
    "body": "When Qualcomm announced its Snapdragon Satellite tech that will let Android phone makers compete with Apples Emergency SOS via satellite, I was almost certain wed see the feature on Samsungs then-upcoming S23 phones.  I mean, why wouldnt we? Qualcomm said the feature would be available this year for phones using its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, and Samsung is launching the first big Android flagship of 2023 with that processor  surely, itll build in this potentially life-saving functionality, like analysts have been predicting for months. And then Samsungs Unpacked event came and went, with no mention of satellite messaging at all, and CNET posted an interview with TM Roh, president and head of Samsungs mobile experience business, where he says this about the tech: when there is the right timing, infrastructure and the technology [is] ready, then of course for Samsung Galaxy, for our mobile division, we would also actively consider adopting this feature as well. Related: Qualcomms going toe-to-toe with Apples satellite messaging feature, https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23538207/qualcomm-satellite-messaging-snapdragon-android Heres what its like to use Apples Emergency SOS via satellite, https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23457970/iphone-14-emergency-sos-satellite-ios-16 Im sorry, what universe am I in? Samsung, which has a storied history of cramming its phones full of features as soon as possible, is saying well wait until the tech is ready, while iPhone users are already using it. (Okay, technically, a similar version of it; Qualcomms tech will use the Iridium satellite network, while Apples partnered with Globalstar. There are differences, but they both enable you to send messages when youre not near a cell tower.)  Roh continued, saying that he doesnt believe being able to message via satellites is the end-all or be-all of the solutions to ensure peace of mind among users.  This feels like a very strange take to me. Sure, there are absolutely limits to satellite connectivity; it gets a lot more sketchy if youre surrounded by trees, which is, you know, where a lot of outdoor recreation happens, and the information you send can be quite limited. And even if youre standing under an open sky, sending a message may require doing a bit of a dance to get your phone pointed at a satellite  something thatd be difficult if you were having a serious medical emergency. But there are also plenty of emergency situations where those limitations wouldnt be a concern and where the tech could genuinely save someones life.  Since the iPhone 14 launched, weve seen at least five people rescued after contacting emergency services via satellite, with each incident prompting a slew of news stories. Search and rescue operators have called the feature a game-changer. Its hard to imagine any ad campaign more effective than the coverage Apple is getting, and Samsung is just... not competing here.  Remember Apples three-minute Dear Apple video from last falls event? It feels certain that the company will line up a similar reel for its next mobile event, featuring people who had satellite connectivity save the day. It just doesnt feel like Samsung to cede any ground, no matter how rare an occurrence is required. And I dont think people talking about how they were able to take a picture with the Ultras 200MP camera, or how their S23s battery lasts a little longer than the S22s did, will make for a very compelling video. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOHj5kGU4fY] \"Will anyone but me care?\" I realize I may be over-indexed on how much the general population cares about off-the-grid communication as someone who both covers connectivity for a living and spends a lot of time away from cell coverage doing dangerous things. (That last part was a joke, mom.) But I do think this feature is going to be a notable absence on spec sheet comparisons, especially if other Android phones start releasing with Qualcomms tech, which it said should be launching in the second half of 2023. I realize that might seem like an obvious explanation for why the S23 seemingly cant talk to satellites; Samsung didnt include the feature because its not ready yet. But as far as I can tell, Qualcomms making use of hardware thats available today, so Samsung couldve built that in and said that satellite messaging would be coming via a software update later this year. (Ive asked Qualcomm if thats possible and will let you know if I hear back.)  Also, remember, Roh didnt say that Samsung couldnt build it in  he more or less said that it just wasnt interested right now. Thatd be a strange response if the tech truly isnt available yet. Even if Snapdragon Satellite is never available on the S23, there is a chance the phones will be able to talk to satellites in the future. Companies like T-Mobile, SpaceX, AST, and Lynk are promising satellite connectivity that uses normal 5G spectrum rather than dedicated hardware like Apple and Qualcomms solutions.

    "body": "0 By Aditya Soni and Medha Singh BENGALURU, India (Reuters)  Shares in Meta Platforms surged more than 20% on Thursday, sweeping the technology sector, after the Facebook owner slashed its spending forecast and increased its share buyback plan by 40 billion euros. dollars. In this tune, the company could see its market value increase by more than 90 billion dollars and the stock record its biggest daily rise in a decade. At around 1:15 pm (Braslia time), the shares jumped 24.9% to $190.465 each. At the maximum, they reached 193 dollars. The Meta rally benefited shares from Amazon.com, Apple and Alphabet, all with a market value of more than 1 trillion dollars. The three companies release their respective balance sheets after the market closes. Metas move announced on Wednesday in the direction of controlling costs marks a dramatic shift for the company, which has spent billions of dollars to turn its futuristic vision of the metaverse into reality, even as its core business suffered from stiff competition and a weak advertising market. Illegally entered via Belarus: Federal Police name new number At least 24 analysts raised target prices for the shares after the balance sheet, with several saying a combination of lower costs, an upbeat revenue growth forecast and share buybacks will boost earnings per share. This is rare, said analysts at Evercorse ISI, referring to positive developments. And stocks react to the rare. The result also provided some relief to the market after Snaps earnings slump reported on Tuesday, which sent technology stocks lower. After the Snap debacle, the fact that Meta wasnt so bad gave tech mega-caps a boost, said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index. There is also a less aggressive Fed, which is also driving demand for growth stocks and technology in general.

We now have 3,00,000 creators who built more than 3 million lenses in Lens Studio,\" Spiegel was quoted as saying.\"So, the democratisation of these tools, I think, will also be very powerful,\" he added.Though Snap's photo-and-video recording glasses \"Spectacles\" have not broken any sales records, the company continues to develop the product.The latest version, the Spectacles 3, goes beyond standard photo and video recording by including new tools such as 3D filters and AR graphics.Spiegel speculated that AI could have an impact on this product as well, due to its ability to improve the AR development process, the report said.\"If we think longer term, five years this is going to be critical to the growth of augmented reality. So today, if you look at AR, there's just a real limitation on what you can build in AR because there's a limited number of 3D models that have been created by artists,\" the CEO was quoted as saying.\"We can use generative AI to help build more of these 3D models very quickly, which can really unlock the full potential of AR and help people make their imagination real in the world.\"Meanwhile, Snap shut down its camera application for Mac and PCs on January 25.Snap Camera allows users to apply filters to their faces while they are on video conference calls.(SJ/IANS)",

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program gives more than 20 million households a monthly allowance for food at grocery stores, with bigger benefits for people with lower incomes. The average monthly benefit for a family of three is around $586. Advertisement The first pandemic relief law Congress passed in 2020 allowed SNAP recipients to receive the maximum benefit for the number of people in a household  $740 for a family of three this year. More than 30 states and the District of Columbia still have the emergency allotments in place, but the extra benefit will go away starting in March. Some 16 million households will see their per-person benefit drop by around $82, according to the Food Research and Action Center, or FRAC, an anti-hunger advocacy group. People who only qualify for the minimum SNAP benefit, such as older Americans receiving Social Security payments, will see their monthly allotment shrink from $281 to $23. The program  formerly known as food stamps  is one of the federal governments biggest income support policies. The lapse of the extra funds could reverberate through the economy as food budgets in affected households collectively drop $2.9 billion, according to FRACs estimate.

But Senate Agriculture Committee chair Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said the shift would ultimately be a good thing. The good news is that we were able to get bipartisan support at the end-of-the-year package to be able to take some of those funds to put into a permanent summer means program for children, Stabenow said. Thats going to feed 29 million children. And so given everything happening, that was a really good result to come out of all this.

    "body": "NYSE: SNAP ) were down 12% on Wednesday, a day after the company reported its fourth quarter 2022 earnings results and provided a lacklustre guidance. Revenue was in line with expectations and earnings surpassed projections but the slow growth and dent in profits disappointed the Street. Heres a look at the good and the bad from the Q4 report: Slow revenue growth Snap reported revenues of $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, which matched expectations but remained relatively flat compared to the year-ago period. Snaps revenue growth has been slowing down over the past couple of quarters going from 38% in the first quarter of 2022 to 6% in the third quarter. So the lack of growth in the latest quarter did not sit well with the Street. The revenue growth was impacted by a double-digit decline in the brand-oriented business. The company continued to face challenges in the form of macroeconomic headwinds, platform policy changes, and increased competition which created a tough operating environment. At the same time, the direct response business managed to grow 4% year-over-year as the company made progress on measurement and optimization. Snap Q4 2022 Earnings Infographic Drop in profits Snap reported adjusted EPS of $0.14 in Q4, which surpassed projections but was down 38% from the year-ago quarter. The company also posted a net loss of $288 million, or $0.18 per share, on a GAAP basis compared to a net income of $22.5 million, or $0.01 per share, in the year-ago period. User growth On the bright side, Snaps daily active users (DAUs) grew 17% year-over-year to 375 million in Q4. DAUs increased both sequentially and year-over-year across all its regions. DAUs reached 100 million in North America while in Europe, they reached 92 million. Rest of World DAUs stood at 183 million and the company sees significant potential for community growth over the long term in this segment. For the first quarter of 2023, Snap expects DAUs to range between 382-384 million.  Bleak outlook Snap did not provide guidance for the first quarter of 2023 due to the challenging operating environment and it expects the headwinds faced in Q4 to persist in Q1. On its quarterly call, the company said it has seen revenue decline 7% YoY thus far in Q1. Its internal forecast assumes revenue will decline 2% to 10% YoY in Q1.

    "body": "Women Get $354 Per Month Less Than Men  Heres Why In California alone, SNAP theft costs the state tens of millions of dollars a year to replace the stolen benefits, Cal Matters reported. In response, the state has proposed to upgrade SNAP security features at a cost of $50 million in next years budget. More From Your Money: Choose a high-interest saving, checking, CD, or investing account from our list of top banks to start saving today. SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is a food purchasing assistance program overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered at the state level. SNAP recipients have their money loaded onto Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards each month  and those cards are a big reason fraud has been on the rise. As GOBankingRates previously reported, EBT cards are designed to work like debit cards. The problem is, they dont have the same built-in protections found with bank-issued debit or credit cards. Much of the fraud involves skimming, in which thieves use a device to steal the card number and PIN off of someone elses electronic benefits payment card. Make Your Money Work for You This is a very expensive problem for agencies that run SNAP  and for the taxpayers who fund them. A study released last fall by consumer reporting agency LexisNexis Risk Solutions found that every $1 of benefits lost through fraud costs SNAP agencies $3.72. This figure includes additional costs related to internal labor and administrative tasks. The cost of fraud is even higher for agencies that accept more applications from mobile and web platforms. Agencies that have more than 20% of mobile channel submissions had an average a loss of $4.40 for every $1 of benefits stolen through fraud, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Because these agencies are funded by taxpayer money, the financial hit is shared by all taxpayers, regardless of whether they qualify for SNAP or not. Fraud and theft involving food stamps have become so rampant that some SNAP recipients want to hold government agencies legally responsible when benefits are stolen. A class-action lawsuit was recently filed against the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance  the agency that oversees SNAP in the state  because it wouldnt reimburse fraud victims for stolen benefits. Make Your Money Work for You [Skimming] extends across the country, MLRI attorney Betsy Gwin told CBS News. The difference we see is the lack of federal protections for EBT users. SNAP fraud victims in California are reimbursed by the state  and there are a lot more of those victims than there were a few years ago. The amount of EBT theft in the Golden State has nearly doubled since 2019, according to data cited by Cal Matters. In many cases, the theft occurs minutes after the benefits are transferred to EBT cards, but it might take weeks for recipients to be reimbursed. More From Your Money: How Much of a Tax Refund Do You Expect in 2023? If you believe youve been the victim of a skimming or phishing scam, the USDA recommends contacting your local SNAP office immediately. You also can report SNAP fraud by state on the USDAs fraud page. You should also take time to research your states refund policy. If you live in a state that covers stolen benefits, youll need to follow its directions for reporting theft. For example, in California beneficiaries can report stolen EBT cards to the EBT customer service helpline, file a police report and fill out a theft report.

The city of Kingston is warning residents to keep an eye on their home pipes, which are susceptible to damage during cold weather. Knowing what steps to take to protect your pipes from freezing can help you prevent the inconvenience and expense of plumbing problems, said Heather Roberts, director of water and wastewater operations. When in doubt about the integrity of your internal plumbing pipes, consider calling a plumber as the problem could worsen. The city suggests locating your master shut-off valve at the water meter, and ensuring it is accessible and operating to know how to quickly turn off the water if a pipe bursts.

    "body": "February 2, 2023 8:46 am Last Updated: February 2, 2023 8:54 am The futures were trading mixed on Thursday, after a wild day on Wall Street to start off February. All the major indexes closed higher on Wednesday, after being down big early on. The big news on the day was of course the increase in the federal funds rate, which came in as expected at 25 basis points to put the rate at the highest level since 2007, 4.50% to 4.75%. There were plenty of mixed opinions on the commentary, as some saw it to be very hawkish while others deemed it more dovish. One thing is for sure: the commentary mentioned future increases (plural), which likely means two more 25-basis-point increases, one in March and one in May, and then perhaps a pause. The worry for the bulls is that the pause could last well into 2024. Treasury yields were down double-digits across the curve after the Fed decision. While the smaller increase was expected, it will not change the inversion between the 10-year note, which closed at 3.40%, and the shorter two-year note, which finished the day at 4.10%. The bond market and many economists using history as a guide maintain the ongoing inversions is a sign that a recession is on the way. Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude were hammered Wednesday, down almost 3%. Analysts cited an inventory build for the selling Wednesday, even though OPEC maintained the production cut levels established back in November. Natural gas closed almost 7% lower, despite the bone-chilling weather across much of the United States. Gold closed the day up, while Bitcoin also finished higher, almost 3% to $23,759.50. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week with a goal of finding fresh ideas for investors and traders alike.

This would be similar in tone to the leaked inspiration for the new alternate jersey  the legendary Bruce Lee. This is the 50th anniversary of the first film Bruce Lee directed, Enter the Dragon. The colors of his martial arts studio were red and yellow, both featured prominently on the possible alternate logo (even if just a mashup). Diving further into the reddit post there are directions to access an adidas Real Fan page, where more colors are revealed. Theres a lot of black in the image, as well as a standard Sounders FC logo but in an alternate gold and black. Zooming in on the scrolling red bands to the left show dragon scales. How do I know those are dragon scales? Because Im a nerd. The yin-yang symbol is in that same yellow that the Bruce Lee Foundation and Bruce Lee Enterprises use.

    "body": "By Jack Murray | Correspondent February 1, 2023 at 11:15 p.m. With a 22 score in the early stages of the third period, getting the next goal was at the top of the priority list for both Duxbury and Plymouth-South. In his first shift of the period, Dragon forward Brady Walsh knew to crash the net hard. Walsh fired the puck into the back of the net and gave the Dragons a lead they would not relinquish, as the top-ranked team in Division 2 defeated the Panthers 42. This was Plymouth Souths first loss since January 4th and the teams first regulation loss since December 14th. Coach told us to have the best shift of our game, Walsh said. Since I was little, my dad told me that when I crash the net, good things happen. The puck came right to my stick and I ended up having the whole net. When you are playing teams that are really hot like that, you need to step up. Duxbury coach Mike Flaherty said. We did that today and got a good win. The Dragons came out flying and capitalized on two early chances. The first came from freshman Anders Kilbourne, who flew into the zone and sniped the puck over the outstretched glove of Panther goaltender Tristian Holmes. A few minutes later, captain Aiden Harrington played copycat, firing a shot into the top corner to extend the lead to 20. The Panthers bit back after this, getting on the board after Logan Souza stuck with his rebound and beat Sam Mazanec to cut the lead in half. The Panthers came out with a purpose in the second period, quickly evening the score via a blast from the point by captain James Lopes. Penalties plagued the teams for the remainder of the period, but neither squad capitalized on the extra ice. We got up quick but then I think we took our foot off the gas a little, Flaherty said. [The penalty kill] worked hard tonight and got it done. Walshs goal, which was assisted by Kilbourne, gave the Dragons the lead but the Panthers did not go away. Mazanec made numerous point-blank saves, including a diving stop on Panther freshman Liam Kaliher. One shot at a time, Mazanec said. I didnt get many shots overall, so its hard to stay in mentally, but I did and made some big saves at the end. The insurance marker came from a cross-crease connection from Braeden Hulett to Chris Gills in the final minutes. The win officially clinched a post-season berth for the Dragons and gave them further progress in the Patriot League standings. Every game counts in the standings and we dont take it for granted, Mazanec said. We come hard and do what we have to do to get it done.",

    "body": "Save Permit me to bring some clarity to an urgent matter around the Dragon gas field. I first want to reassert the position of the United National Congress (UNC) on this matter. I take note of the narrative that the UNC Opposition is bashing/criticising the Dragon field opportunity. This is a false narrative. At no time has the UNC taken a position that the lifting of partial sanctions and access to the Dragon gas field is anything other than a great opportunity for Trinidad and Tobago. However, as a constitutional Opposition, we are not a rubber stamp for the Government. Our primary role is to scrutinise each and every decision. We have a duty and mandate to hold the Government to account. After careful analysis of all the issues, we have expressed credible concerns on peripheral matters around the granting of the permission by the US Treasury Department to have access to the field for development. While the announcement is welcomed and holds excellent potential for the countrys energy future, it is not a quick fix from the current grim industry realities plaguing the sector. While the UNC is heartened at the approval for monetising the Dragon field, we note that the PNM (Peoples National Movement) Government is still bungling with respect to measures to place the energy sector on a growth path. The addition of 350 million standard cubic feet of feedstock from Dragon is a positive development, especially for the long-suffering manufacturers of the Point Lisas Industrial Estate. We are also aware of the global demand for cheap, clean fuel. The tightening supply of Russian gas is good news for Trinidad and Tobago and its capacity to fill some of that void and be a major player in regional energy supply and security. The UNC National Transformation Plan of 2020 focused on friendlier fiscal regimes for new and existing operators in the deep-water fields. A UNC government would create new and improved legislative policy mechanics to bring unsanctioned fields into production within much shorter time frames than currently exist. It is worth noting that Guyana was able to accomplish this in four-to-five-year windows. The UNC remains committed to the development of the oil and gas sector in Trinidad and Tobago. We look forward to the decarbonising of the sector and improved fiscal regimes for near-shore and deep-water exploration. We urge the Government to work towards shorter horizon windows as capital has newer, low-cost emerging hydrocarbon fields and options for investments in renewables. In summary, the UNC has not criticised the Dragon gas field opportunity but has expressed concerns about matters surrounding the granting of permission for access to the field and for developmental challenges regarding the constraints as set out by the US Treasury Department. We are also deeply concerned by the silence of the Government in Caracas almost after one week of the US announcement. The UNC sees the opportunity as a positive development for Trinidad and Tobagos energy future, but notes that the Governments handling of measures to place the energy sector on a growth path is still lacking.

It first appeared on the screen thanks to Urusei Yatsura. Bulma appeared in Urusei Yatsura, Remember My Love the third film adapted from the work of Rumiko Takahashi.

    "description": "Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is an expansive and imaginative action/RPG with plenty to offer longtime series fans. The open-world elements arent as ambitious as they could have been, though.",
    "body": "Release Date: January 16, 2020 / January 13, 2023 Genre: Action/RPG If the title Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot means anything to you, theres a good chance that youre in the games target audience. If you know that Dragon Ball Z is one of the most popular anime series of all time, and that Kakarot is another name for smiley series protagonist Goku, you may well enjoy spending a few dozen hours in a semi-open-world action/RPG based on the franchise. If not, there are better open-world games out there  not to mention better anime adaptations. And yet, the appeal of DBZ: Kakarot is not that its a groundbreaking video game. Instead, the game manages to infuse a little life into a story weve heard a thousand times before thanks to a solid combat system, a stylish presentation and just enough new elements to keep things interesting. Its easy to see how the game could have broken through from good to great  more meaningful exploration, better side content, a less predictable story, and so forth. But in the expansive pantheon of Dragon Ball games , Kakarot is much closer to the top than the bottom. Thanks to a recent free upgrade for current-gen consoles, DBZ: Kakarot has recently found itself back in the spotlight, and rightly so. If you missed out on this adventure the first time around, now is a great time to dive in  and if youve already played it, some substantive new DLC makes it worth revisiting. Read on for our full Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review: Gameplay Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is, first and foremost, an action/RPG. As I noted when I previewed the game back in 2019 , the game flirts with some open-world elements, including free-roaming levels, sprawling side quests, multiple earnable currencies and so forth. But fighting enemies, gaining experience and customizing your skill set are still at the core of the experience. And that experience can be a pretty rewarding one, provided that youre already all aboard the Dragon Ball train. (Image credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.) The game essentially retells a slightly shortened version of the entire Dragon Ball Z anime, where youll take control of Goku, champion martial artist and defender of Earth, as well as a few of his allies and rivals. From there, youll do battle with both faceless goons and big-name baddies in fast-paced, chaotic real-time fights. (Image credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.) Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot hangs on an enjoyable, albeit unbalanced, combat system. As Goku and friends, youll fly around open battlefields, locking onto enemies and pummeling them into submission with both melee and energy attacks. Melee combos are reliant on a single button, while you can upgrade and customize the energy attacks you want to use. Its a simple, straightforward affair, although the difficulty curve is all over the place. Random encounter enemies are positively laughable, while some of the games bosses can easily trounce you  unless youve brought along a bevy of healing items, which you can use to trivialize many fights. Kakarots combat is more about style than substance, but said style is self-assured enough to carry the game. (Image credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.) Some gameplay systems in DBZ: Kakarot are almost oddly faithful to the anime, which can work both in the games favor and to its detriment. For example, most random encounter enemies give pitiful experience point rewards, while the games infrequent side quests are not much more generous. Instead, characters gain massive amounts of XP during story cutscenes, or after boss fights. This means you cant simply grind your way past bosses, and, in theory, could feel some of the same desperation and triumph that the characters onscreen felt during those battles. But it also means that simply waiting for the story to advance often gives you much better rewards than putting in effort on your own. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review: Open-world elements While Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is not a truly open-world game, it does take a lot of cues from the genre. Each level you explore in Kakarot is a huge, sprawling environment, which often contains multiple biomes, such as grasslands, deserts, marshes, snowfields, cities and more. On the one hand, the games semi-open design adds a lot to what could otherwise be a fairly rote action/RPG. After all, the Dragon Ball anime isnt just a series of fights; its also about a group of magnetic characters exploring a variety of memorable locations, from Master Roshis colorful Kame House, to Bulmas bustling West City, to Friezas deadly spaceship on Planet Namek. Getting to travel freely through these areas is pure wish fulfillment for fans of the show, and makes the game feel like a more cohesive whole. (Image credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.) On the other hand, theres not actually that much to do in Kakarots sprawling levels. Each one has a lot of empty space, populated only by crafting and cooking resources, as well as Z Orbs: currency to upgrade your special abilities. After youve spent 10 or 15 minutes flying through the colorful-but-lifeless expanses, youll have seen pretty much all there is to see. Interestingly, the games side quests give us a glimpse into what Kakarot could have been, if it had been a little more assiduous about its open-world elements. In each chapter, youll encounter a handful of optional missions  but only a handful. These involve fighting enemies or collecting resources for some fan-favorite side characters, including Android 8 and Yajirobe, and they often confer generous rewards. There arent all that many side quests, however, and theyre not available between every single major plot point, making them feel like disjointed asides rather than integral parts of the game. (Image credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.) DBZ: Kakarot toys with a few other unconventional systems  multiple playable protagonists, a Community Board of upgradable side characters who can enhance your abilities, a branching skill tree, and so forth. But none of them feels as full-featured as the combat, which is just good enough to support the game on its own. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review: Story Fans of the anime may be both pleased and exhausted to hear that Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot follows the story of the series almost to the letter. Pleased is a reasonable response to the game following the entire story, from the arrival of the Saiyans through the defeat of Majin Buu  as is exhausted, due to the fact that weve already heard this particular story innumerable times in the manga, anime and endless video game adaptations. (Image credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.) For anyone who hasnt already heard this story ad infinitum, DBZ: Kakarot tells the story of Goku: a happy-go-lucky martial artist who discovers that hes actually part of a warlike alien race called the Saiyans. When the other Saiyans invade Earth, Goku and a small group of colorful warriors fight to save the planet  and then t",

However, no matter what challenge comes your way, it is always possible to communicate seamlessly with everyone. Thus, many have wondered how this is possible in dragonball. Well, actually there is an official answer that clarifies this doubt. To begin, on the planet Earth of Dragon Ball there are no nations like in the real world, but everything is included in a single kingdom, where everyone speaks a common language. While some regions have unique dialects, at the end of the day everyone can speak in only one way to understand each other. This doesnt just apply to humans, but to creatures like Oolong and Puar. The interesting thing is that this common language is not unique to planet Earth, but rather exists throughout the entire universe. This is something that can be seen in action when Frieza arrives on Namek. While Piccolos race has its own language, They are also able to speak in a general way so that everyone understands each other.. In this way, Akira Toriyama manages to explain how all the Dragon Ball characters can understand each other.",

    "body": "0 Dragon Ball is one of the biggest franchises in the world, and its legacy continues to grow by the day. Goku and Vegeta have woven a wild tale during their tenure that fans are exploring to this day. Of course, the show's popularity means new fans are coming to Dragon Ball in droves, so some of the anime's wildest history can be overlooked. But right now, it seems the conversation about Bulma and her shocking anime debut has taken over the fandom. The whole conversation came to light on social media as trivia so often does. It was there fans began sharing unsung facts about anime and animation, so Dragon Ball was brought up a number of times. However, the fact that took most fans by surprise was Bulma's first appearance in anime. After all, she did not make her debut in Dragon Ball but rather Urusei Yatsura : Remember My Love. Bulmas first animated appearance was not the first episode of Dragon Ball but actually the final scene of Urusei Yatsura: Remember My Love, which came out only three months after the DB manga started, with her appearance being based on her outfit on the title page of chapter 4. https://t.co/6IbAeuCOkC January 26, 2023 As you can see above, the special features Bulma as we see her in the cover page for Dragon Ball chapter four. With a bow tying back her lilac hair, Bulma looks ready to ride with her gloves, cargo pants, and a padded top. This look is definitely an underrated one for the character, and of course, it features her early manga color palette. But at the time, well  Dragon Ball had not debuted to set things straight with Bulma. Urusei Yatsura managed to fit in this cameo just three months after Dragon Ball was released, so the team worked quickly. It would take the actual Dragon Ball anime more than a year to bring Bulma to television on its own. After all, Akira Toriyama released his manga in late 1984, and the anime's premiere went live in February 1986. This means Urusei Yatsura brought Bulma to the anime world first, and this isn't the only cameo the anime did. During its run, Urusei Yatsura has welcomed Kenshiro from Fist of the North Star and Appleseed's Briareos. The fun-loving series is not afraid to rope in other IPs when cameos are called for. So if you consider yourself one of Bulma's top fans, we suggest you check out her real anime debut in Urusei Yatsura if you haven't yet! Related:",

    "description": "Your knowledge of all things Dragon Ball will be over 9,000 in no time.",
    "body": "/ Updated: Feb. 1, 2023  10:59 am EST Whether you're a fan of anime or not, you've most likely heard of \"Dragon Ball.\" The iconic series, created by Akira Toriyama, has helped define modern-day Shonen anime with creatively designed characters, worlds, and stories. The anime grew past its original conception as an action-comedy, eventually spanning two sequel series, with \"Dragon Ball Z\" becoming the most well-known of the many series made thus far. Consisting of five different shows with a total of 806 episodes and 20 movies, getting into this famous series can feel overwhelming. After all, there are multiple avenues to take to experience the story of Goku and the rest of the Z fighters. \"Dragon Ball,\" tells the story of Son Goku, a young warrior who goes on a journey to become a strong and capable fighter. With otherworldly strength and a peculiar monkey tail, Goku makes all sorts of acquaintances and enemies (who later become friends). Along the way, Goku learns about the mythical Dragon Balls and how once they are all gathered, someone can use them to summon Shenron, a creature that can grant one wish. \"Dragon Ball,\" which aired from 1986-1989, covers Goku's childhood and training. \"Dragon Ball Z\" picks up five years after the end of the first series and aired from 1989-96. Following the ending of that series, the non-canonical \"Dragon Ball GT\" would air from 1996-97, and the franchise would triumphantly return in 2015 with the canonical \"Dragon Ball Super,\" airing its most recent episode in 2018. To help decide how you want to view the classic anime, we at /Film have created this guide to help newcomers to the franchise better understand their options. The competionist journey: Dragon Ball Toei Animation Some Shonen fans may skip the \"Dragon Ball\" series entirely because, while it has its fair share of action, the original series is much more of a comedy. This first installment has a different sense of adventure than \"Dragon Ball Z.\" Almost everything in \"Dragon Ball\" is played for jokes until Piccolo shows up later in the story. However, the series is still the starting point of Goku's journey. If you're looking for the complete experience, dip your toes in a different adventure serial type of anime. For those who have only known about \"Dragon Ball Z,\" it could be a refreshing departure that is a more lighthearted watch than its sequel series. \"Dragon Ball\" consists of 153 episodes and has the foes Goku goes up against while retrieving Dragon Balls or going through training feeling like shadows of the major villains that take the stage in the next series. If you're looking for some of the highlights of this original \"Dragon Ball,\" look no further than the \"Tournament Saga\" (episodes 14-28), the \"King Piccolo Saga\" (episodes 102-122), and the \"Piccolo Jr. Saga\" (episode 123- 153). Each of these highlight what people love about \"Dragon Ball\" incredible action and fights fueled by rivalries that later become friendships, along with planting the seeds for the next chapter of the story in \"Dragon Ball Z.\" This is the perfect starting point for fans who want the complete experience. Follow it up with: \"Dragon Ball Z,\" then \"Dragon Ball Super.\" The Shonen everyone talks about: Dragon Ball Z Toei Animation The end of \"Dragon Ball\" has Goku as an adult, married to Chi-Chi, and feels like a proper bookend for the start of the story. The next chapter, \"Dragon Ball Z,\" is arguably the most well-known. \"Dragon Ball Z\" changed the perception of Japanese animation in Western pop culture, normalizing the appreciation of what was formerly a niche genre of television. The first arc of the series exemplifies everything great about it, as the Saiyan Saga (episodes 1-35) provides insight into Goku's origins and flips the world's status quo on its head. Add to that the introduction of characters like Goku's son Gohan or the prince of Saiyans Vegeta, who starts as a villain at the beginning of the series, and it's easy to start this next step in your \"Dragon Ball\" journey and never look back. Goku isn't the only character who takes the spotlight, either. \"Dragon Ball Z\" is much more of a generational story, showing Gohan coming into his own as a person and a fighter while humanizing Piccolo, a primary antagonist from the previous series. Stick with the series long enough, and you can bear witness to one of the most iconic moments in all of anime  Goku becoming Super Saiyan in the \"Frieza Saga\" (episodes 75-107). It's a chill-inducing arc that sets the precedent for many more transformations down the line. If you decide to skip \"Dragon Ball\" and go straight into \"Z,\" it shouldn't be a problem. However, cutting around arcs in this 291-episode series may end up lessening the dramatic effect some of these emotionally cathartic episodes entail. Purists may want to watch this original series in all its unedited glory. Follow it up with: \"Dragon Ball Super.\" The filler-free Shonen experience: Dragon Ball Z Kai Toei Animation If the comedic origins of \"Dragon Ball\" don't interest you and you're wanting to get straight into the classic Shonen everyone talks about without the filler, \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" is the perfect starting point. Clocking in at 167 episodes (compared to the original \"Z's\" 291 episodes), there's significantly less filler in this re-animated version of the original \"Dragon Ball Z\" anime. Featuring re-recorded voice tracks and new HD animation, it's a perfectly suitable abridged version of the \"Dragon Ball Z\" story. The original version of this story was made just as chapters of the manga were being released, forcing the studio to slow down the pace and add in their own filler so that they wouldn't get too ahead of the manga. Thankfully, \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" had none of those restraints, and with the manga complete, was able to tell the story as concisely as possible. Anime filler has been the bane of many people's viewings of other big anime like \"Bleach\" or \"One Piece,\" so the rarity of having an updated version of the story may make \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" the best way to experience the story. At the end of the day, it's all a matter of preference, and \"Dragon Ball\" gives you two different ways to experience the most popular of its three series. Whether it's \"Dragon Ball Z\" or \"Dragon Ball Z Kai,\" all roads lead to the newest series. Follow it up with: \"Dragon Ball Super.\" The latest and greatest: Dragon Ball Super Toei Animation to \"Dragon Ball Super\": 298 episodes. Canon movies that continue the story of Dragon Ball Super Toei Animation If by now you've watched all the series you've wanted and think you've completed your \"Dragon Ball\" journey, think again. While \"Dragon Ball Super\" hasn't aired a new episode since 2018, two films have been released that are canon to the \"Dragon Ball Super\" anime and continue the story in new and exciting ways. Both movies released so far have stories written by creator Akira Toriyama and are the final step in watching the entire story of the anime. \"Dragon Ball Super: Broly\": Released in 2",

    "body": "Tweet Android Woman says she wasnt that android woman. Instead of having a sit-down breakfast at home in the morning, a lot of young people in Japan just grab an onigiri (rice ball) at the convenience store. Of course, after grabbing the rice ball, youre supposed to pay for it, but thats not how things transpired at a convenience store in the town of Eniwa, in Hokkaido Prefecture, on January 25. At about 8:30 a.m., a 29-year-old woman walked into the shop, grabbed a 213-yen (US$1.65) onigiri from the shelf, and walked out with it. A clerk called the police and told the, what happened, and when officers arrived on the scene and questioned the woman, she admitted to stealing the onigiri and was placed under arrest for shoplifting. When asked her name, however, she replied with Android. To clarify, no, Android is not a Japanese name, but it is a relatively understood loanword in Japan with the same meaning it has in English: a humanoid robot. News of Androids arrest quickly spread through online circles in Japan, prompting a response from yet another self-claimed android. Android Woman (Android no One-san in Japanese) is a YouTuber and media personality whos appeared in TV commercials and in-person/in-robot at events. Also known as Android Woman Saori, her hook is that she speaks and moves like an android, with a controlled, even measure to her voice and precise, controlled movements. September 22, 2017 Android Woman has never listed her age in an official profile, but since she has the appearance of a woman in her 20s. So when people began hearing about a 29-year-old woman calling herself Android whod gotten in trouble with the law, some assumed it must be Android Woman whod been caught shoplifting. Thats not the case, though, Android Woman says. Today I have an urgent announcement, she beings in a video posted the day after the shoplifting incident. On a certain Internet forum, I saw a thread with the title Android Woman has been arrested, so I would like to clear things up. That android is not meWe are close in age, so even I was surprised, but I am not in Hokkaido now.  Android Womans self-introduction video As dedicated to her performances as she is, Android Woman goes on to say that if she were ever the subject of a police questioning, she would drop the shtick and give her actual, legal name. Meanwhile, the identity of the Android who took the onigiri, as of this writing, has not yet been revealed.

    "body": "May the fourth be with us! Image via Disney+ Disney+ and Lucasfilm have revealed today the release date for the second volume of the animated anthology series Star Wars: Visions. Featuring animated shorts from all over the world, the second volume of the beloved series will be appropriately released on May 4, also known as Star Wars Day. The first season of Star Wars: Visions made the galaxy far, far away, just like Japan, with different studios specialized in anime getting free rein to come up with new non-canon stories. While every episode of Volume 1 features a unique art style, the entire season draws from anime culture to show fans how diverse Star Wars can be. Volume 2 is doubling down on this premise by bringing nine new animated shorts coming from nine different countries. That means instead of only giving us more anime Star Wars, Lucasfilm is asking artists all around the globe to reimagine the galaxy with different cultural elements. Commenting on the release date announcement, James Waugh, executive producer and Senior Vice President of Franchise Content & Strategy at Lucasfilm, said: The reaction to the first volume of Star Wars: Visions blew us away. We were delighted that this project inspired and resonated with so many people. We always saw Star Wars: Visions as a framework for celebratory expressions of the franchise from some of the best creators working today. Animation is in a global renaissance, and were constantly staggered by the amount of creativity pushing the medium forward. With Volume 1, the imaginative minds of Japans anime industry were on full display. With Volume 2, we expanded our canvas to take audiences on a global tour of some of the most talented creators from around the world. Were so proud to be able to reveal the line-up of studios weve assembled. Every short is incredible, full of heart, scope, imagination, and the values that make stories distinctly Star Wars  all while opening up bold new ways of seeing what a Star Wars story can be.

    "description": "What's motivating the multinational effort to restrict China from chip-making tools.",
    "body": "persuaded the Netherlands and Japan to restrict exports of high-tech chip-making equipment to China. Along with the U.S., the Netherlands and Japan are home to some of the most important companies that produce the equipment needed to make advanced semiconductors. This effort to control exports, kicked off by the Biden administration last October, takes direct aim at Chinas capacity to make the best microchips. Marketplaces Sabri Ben-Achour spoke with Chris Miller, a professor of history at Tufts Universitys Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, about whats behind this move. The reality is that history shows whenever powerful countries have access to advanced computing capabilities, they deploy this for intelligence and military uses, said Miller, who is also author of Chip War: The Fight for the Worlds Most Critical Technology. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Sabri Ben-Achour: So I think we need to start with explaining the why. Why any of this? Why is the U.S. so intent on blocking China from accessing high-end computer chips? Chris Miller: Well, high-end computer chips of the type that are controlled by the U.S. regulations are used in advanced data centers where AI systems are trained. And today, theres just a small number of countries that basically control the supply chain for producing these chips. And thats why the U.S. is trying to restrict access to the types of tools you need to make these chips from being sent to China. Ben-Achour: Is this a national security issue? Or is this really an economic competition issue and a desire to sort of maintain economic prosperity? Miller: No, this is completely about national security concerns. The reality is that history shows whenever powerful countries have access to advanced computing capabilities, they deploy this for intelligence and military uses. Whether its some of the first computers that were deployed by the British during World War II, to crack Nazi codes, or whether its the U.S. use of supercomputers during the Cold War to track Soviet submarines. In the Cold War, the KGB and Soviet Union and the National Security Agency in the U.S. had privileged access to their countrys most advanced computers for signals intelligence purposes. And today, there is no doubt that all of the worlds key powers are thinking harder than ever about how to apply artificial intelligence to espionage, to signals intelligence and to military systems. And thats exactly what these controls are trying to target. Ben-Achour: The U.S. had to fight kind of hard to get other countries on board with its sanctions against Huawei, for example. Was it a hard sell to get Japan and the Netherlands to join the U.S. on restricting chip exports? Miller: I dont think it was that hard of a sell given that a deal was struck relatively quickly. And I think actually, if you look at debate in the Netherlands, as well as in Japan, what you find is that theres been a real shift in views about China, as well as a shift in views about the military and security applications of artificial intelligence and advanced computing. Ben-Achour: The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinas top institute for nuclear weapons research has been buying and using high-end U.S. computer chips that were supposedly restricted from going to China all the way back in 1997. So how effective do you think this round of exclusion is going to be? Miller: Previously it was illegal to send U.S. chips to military uses in China, but legal to sell them to companies that said they were going to use them for civilian purposes. But the reality is that the same types of chips that can train a car to drive semi-autonomously, can also train a military drone to fly semi-autonomously. And there were plenty of well documented, open source reporting about ways that ostensibly civilian uses were actually helping the Chinese military. And so the new U.S. regulation prohibits any advanced chips of this type to be sent to China. Ben-Achour: Do you think China could get around this somehow? Get those chips elsewhere? Miller: Well, theyre going to try but I think itll be difficult for a couple of reasons. First off, the chips are produced by one company, in one factory in Taiwan. And because the distribution networks for this particular type of chip are relatively narrow and trackable, I think the U.S. has a reasonable case to make that its going to do a pretty good job of limiting Chinas access to this type of chip. Ben-Achour: Can it not start developing its own high-end chips? How far away do you think we are from that? Miller: The reality is that today, all of the most advanced chip making facilities in China, only work because theyre able to import tools from abroad from the U.S., from Japan and from the Netherlands. And right now, there simply arent credible domestic competitors in China for these tools from foreign companies. So Chinas certainly gonna spend more money trying to build up a chip industry, but its got a really difficult pathway ahead because right now its years behind, when it comes to manufacturing the machine tools that are needed to make chips.

Manu, who earned the DP World Tour membership by virtue of being the top player on the PGTI Tour, is making his first appearance on the Tour this week.

On the back, he again birdied 10th and 15th and his only dropped shot came on the Par-5 18th, where he went into the rough on the left and then missed a 12-foot par putt. Hisatsune, just 21, has had excellent results on the local Japan Tour and their Challenge Tour. He has also played on the DP World Tour and in Asia earlier.

    "body": "Tom Llewellyn Tomo-chan is a Girl/Lay Duce/Aniplex YouTube channel As the anime adaptation continues to impress fans worldwide, many are wondering if the Tomo-chan is a Girl manga has already finished. There are a number of popular romantic comedy anime series airing on the 2023 Winter slate, with arguably the best being Studio Lay-duces Tomo-chan is a Girl. However, with the anime providing millions of fans with the mid-week cheer that we all need, many are now looking to start reading the original manga series. So, has the original Tomo-chan is a Girl manga already finished, or is the series still releasing new chapters in Japan? EXPLAINED: February 2, 2023 Has the Tomo-chan is a Girl manga finished? Yes, the original Tomo-chan is a Girl manga series, written and illustrated by Fumita Yanagida, has sadly already finished. The series began serialization domestically in Japan on the Twi4 Twitter account before moving to the Saizensen website from April 7, 2015 to July 14, 2019. On September 24, 2018, Yanagida confirmed in a now-deleted Twitter post that volume 8 was indeed the final installment of the romantic comedy series. A total of eight complete Tankobon volumes of the Tomo-chan is a Girl manga were published in Japan under the Kodansha banner. Thankfully, all eight available volumes have already been published in English with Seven Seas Entertainment. Tomo and Jun have been best buds since they were little kids, but now that theyre in high school, Tomo wants to be more than friendstoo bad Jun just sees her as one of the guys. Tomo may be a tomboy, but shes determined to prove to Jun that shes a woman, too!  Volume 1 preview, via Seven Seas Entertainment. EPIC: February 2, 2023 Fans of the ongoing anime adaptation can purchase physical copies of the original manga via Right Stuf, Bookshop, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Books A Million, Indigo, Indiebound, Powells, Walmart, and Waterstones. Alternatively, if fans want to read the original manga series online, digital versions are also available to read via Amazon Kindle, Book Walker, Google Play, Kobo, and Nook. Tomo-chan is a Girl also won the coveted Next Manga Award in the web manga category in 2016. Anime News Networks Rebecca Silverman praised the manga for its engaging art and humor, noting how this is a series that can cheer you up after a long day. Theres sort of a hurried feel to Yanagidas art, but its still attractive and really works for emphasizing both the comedy and the pathos of the situations the characters find themselves in. Whether theyre trying to navigate sharing an umbrella or discussing karate, the characters interact with another naturalness to sell the humor of the situations.  Rebecca Silverman, via ANN. New episodes from the anime adaptation air every Wednesday on Crunchyroll.

    "body": "Mail Comments The handover ceremony of the reconstructed Shree Sahid Jagat Prakash Jung Shah Sanskrit Secondary School took place in Bidur Municipality, Nuwakot District on February 2. The school was severely damaged by the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake, but it has been reconstructed under the \"Emergency School Reconstruction Project\" (ESRP), which is a Japan assisted project to reconstruct many schools. On behalf of the Government of Japan Kikuta Yutaka, Ambassador of Japan to Nepal, sent his congratulatory video speech to the people who have made contributions under the ESRP, in particular, the team of Shree Sahid Jagat Prakash Jung Shah Sanskrit Secondary School. Ambassador Kikuta stated that \"Japan launched ESRP aiming to reconstruct 274 schools in total, covering six severely hit districts. As of today, 273 schools, including this one, have been completed. Moreover, ESRP aims to rebuild and refurbish schools under the concept of \"Build Back Better\" to make schools more earthquake resilient.\" Ambassador Kikuta welcomed the increase in the number of students during the reconstruction of the school. The school is now receiving students from all over Nepal. He also mentioned that 2022 was the 120th year since Nepal dispatched its first eight students to Japan for study, and expressed his hope to see many students who have studied or are studying in the school play a future leading role in the people-to-people relationship between the two countries as well as in the development of Nepal. The Embassy of Japan in Nepal hopes that the ESRP schools further strengthen the relationship between Japan and Nepal, and the friendship between the peoples of the two countries for future generations.

    "description": "And I don't feel all that fine.",
    "body": "Tweet And I dont feel all that fine. Much like how a bluebird heralds the beginning of spring, it seems the late winter months in Japan are often greeted by someone doing something horribly disgusting in a revolving sushi restaurant. Whether its putting cameras on the belt to peek into everyones booth or intentionally dropping fish in the garbage, it seems there is something about the end of the frigid weather that really brings out the jerk in some people. While this behavior seemed to die down since the pandemic began, it now appears to be back with a vengeance. At the end of January a video went viral of a teen licking various items in his booth like the bottle of soy sauce and a self-service drinking cup, and then returning them for the next customer to unknowingly use at a branch of conveyor belt sushi chain Sushiro in Gifu Prefecture.  Sushiro is one of the leading restaurants of its kind and often enjoyed by our staff The incident has since been widely dubbed daeki tero (saliva terrorism) and the terrorist responsible has since turned himself in to the authorities and, along with his parents, apologized to the company. However, considering the company that owns the restaurant chain saw a five percent dip in stock price right after the video came out, they might not be satisfied with a simple apology.  Sushiro: If the stock price fell due to soy-sauce-licking shock, that would amount to a loss of 10 billion yen (US$76M) in total market value at this point in time. If that store in Gifu loses sales due to harmful rumors and is forced to close a causal relationship can be confirmed and a claim for damages, including lost profits, could easily amount to hundreds of millions of yen. January 31, 2023 Not only that but Sushiro along with all the other revolving sushi chains have a major trust issue on their hands. This daeki tero boy is much like a cockroach in that Actually, hes like a cockroach in a lot of ways but mainly in that when you see one, you can envision therere a hundred more out there, and in any posting of the video on social media, youre sure to find several comments to the effect of, Im never eating conveyor belt sushi again. The idea of having your food float through a room of strangers before eating it became a lot more problematic when COVID-19 hit, and things like daeki tero certainly arent helping. Kura Sushi, another conveyor belt sushi chain, announced that they are installing microchips on the cases that hold the plates of sushi. In addition to monitoring how long theyve been sitting on the belt, theyll be able to detect if the case has been tampered with so customers can avoid sushi that may have been compromised. Meanwhile, Hama Sushi, yet another conveyor belt sushi chain, abolished the public conveyor way back in March 2020 due to the pandemic. Instead, they rely solely on the express belts used by most major chains in which the customer orders from a touchscreen at their seat and their desired dish zooms right to their table. Immediately following the daeki tero incident rumors swirled that Sushiro had gone the same route but the company has officially denied those rumors, saying they are instead making changes to how utensils and seasonings are stored.  Orders can often be made from a tablet installed at each table or the customers smartphone. In addition to keeping it away from idiots, ordering sushi directly way has the added benefits of it being more freshly made and not having to wait for the topping you want to eventually make its way across the entire restaurant at a snails pace. It also helps the restaurant to keep a tighter rein on its stock during busy and slow times. Because of this, express lanes have been in partial use for a long time now, and most people would probably understand if revolving sushi restaurants evolved their conveyor belt system to only use them. Kura Sushi at least seems to be making a concerted effort to maintain the classic formula, but with the increased public awareness of incidents like daeki tero, its difficult to say how long even they can hold on. However, one of the many comments about this issue posed the most important existential question: If a revolving sushi restaurants sushi doesnt revolve, isnt it just a regular sushi restaurant? I dont see how any of this is protecting the soy sauce and cups though. Theyll have to switch to individually packaged sauce and paper cups. Its not great for the environment though. Just keeping the food stocked in the back is fine. We dont need it moving around. Im fine with takeout, thanks. I think even if therere only express belts therell be guys trying to spit on it as it moves past. How about banning anyone under 18 from entering? Whatever system renovations Sushiro needs to do should be paid for by that daeki tero fool. There really is something to just having food casually float by and plucking out whatever looks appealing rather than having to think about what you want to eat. Sometimes, something unexpected passes by and ends up being an especially memorable treat to make the overall experience that much better.  Just look at that smile Itll be sad if that experience disappears, but daeki tero and deadly viruses might end up being why we cant have nice things.

The gateway to the EU: Why Dublin became a bustling tech hub Dublin has emerged in recent years as a major hub for Europe's tech industry. - 02/02/2023            -17:44 By Kirstie McDermott Ireland began to establish its tech credentials in the early 2000s with the arrival of industry behemoth Google, which moved its European headquarters to Dublin in 2004. The city is now seen as one of Europes leading tech hubs, and is home to the EMEA headquarters for a large array of big tech companies, including Hubspot and Indeed. While there are a few different areas of concentration in the city and its environs, including a cluster to the west (home to PayPal and eBay), and another in the southern suburbs (where youll find Microsoft and Salesforce), it is Dublins docklands area - nicknamed Silicon Docks' - that attracts the most attention. Just a short stroll from the city centre proper, this area is home to a thriving collection of start-ups, scale-ups and big national and international firms across the financial and tech sectors, all mixed in with great places to eat, drink and discover. Like all urban centres, Dublin isn't perfect. Drawbacks include a high cost of living (somewhat tempered by high wages in the tech sector), housing scarcity and rising inflation. Despite some negatives, it remains a great place to carve out a tech career. Here are four reasons why. 1. Plenty of opportunity Opportunity knocks, with more than 90,766 people employed in information and communications technology (ICT) across 5,178 companies, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Around 4,400 of these were actually domestic companies, with these organisations accounting for almost half of employment across the entire sector. Since the advent of Brexit, Ireland is now the only English-speaking country in the European Union. The new restrictions between the EU and the UK are having some positive benefits for Ireland's digitally-intensive sectors. More than meatballs: Stockholm is a world-class tech hub in Europe Acting as a gateway to the rest of the bloc, which is an attractive prospect for multinational companies, Ireland also has a young and highly-educated workforce. Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)s annual Education at a Glance report last year placed Ireland in the top three of the 38 OECD member countries for its rate of third-level education attainment. The report found that 54 per cent of Irish people have achieved third-level education, 13 points higher than the OECD average of 41 per cent. It also stated that 63 per cent of 18-24 year olds in Ireland are currently in education, compared to the EU average of 59 per cent.

You will work closely with the companys development and product team to develop, modify and support Ryanairs applications, website and user interfaces across all channels. 2. High wages If you are working in the tech sector in Dublin, then you are part of a cohort of workers with the highest annual earnings in Ireland, according to data from the CSO. Tech employees received a total of 8.5 billion in wages in 2019, with local companies paying out 2 billion that year. Also according to the CSO, average annual earnings were 45,324 in 2022, an increase of 2.4 per cent from 2021. The tech sector scores significantly higher, with median earnings of 73,500. In-demand jobs include Java developers, project managers and DevOps. Guidewire Software is seeking a Design (UX) Researcher in Dublin right now. Youll be in charge of guiding, organising, and executing research. Working with support from the lead design researcher, you will help UX designers and product managers in Dublin and Poland to determine when and how the research will help them make better business and design decisions. Work-life balance, great opportunities and attractive city: Why you should get a tech job in Berlin 3. Innovation is supported According to EU data, venture capital funding into Irish SMEs increased by 34 per cent to 309 million in the third quarter of 2022, bringing the total above the 1 billion mark. The leading areas were cybersecurity and fintech, each raising 28 per cent of total funding. A wide range of support and funding is available for startups here, including numerous campus incubation centres, plus financial support from the government for SMEs and start-up companies. The national startup accelerator programme (NDRC) is also on hand to support globally ambitious tech entrepreneurs in Ireland. For those looking to work in a long-established company, Deloitte is seeking a Data Privacy Senior Manager in Dublin to identify new internet regulations that could impact clients strategic direction, helping establish governance, risk and compliance capabilities across large clients, including setting up specific second line functions such as trust and safety. A shortage of tech workers could be on the horizon. Is it time for you to upskill? 4. It's a great place to live Dublin is a great place to work, and despite high rents and a dearth of housing, it remains an attractive place to live, offering an urban experience combined with easy access to nature. You can easily walk or cycle anywhere you need to go in the city, and there are plenty of parks and green spaces where you can enjoy some fresh air after a long day at the office. Additionally, Dublin is on the coast, and boasts many places to swim and walk its sandy beaches. Dublin is next to Co Wicklow, home to the Wicklow mountains, which offer a variety of hiking and climbing opportunities. For those interested in culture, there are thriving theatre and music scenes, plenty of free-to-enter art galleries and museums, high quality restaurants and of course, a multitude of its famous pubs.",

    "body": "Where will most tech company leasing take place this year? And how much will these companies lease? Image courtesy of geralt via pixabay For years, technology companies could be counted on for rapid growth and robust leasing activity. But the economy is uncertain, and hybrid work is making companies rethink where and how much space they need. As a result, the brokers who helped tech firms expand exponentially are now helping them take a more nuanced approach to leasing new space. CRE brokers who work with tech firms share insights on what these tenants want and need today. Shifting Priorities Luke Ogelsby, a CBRE Excutive Vice President in San Francisco, told Commercial Property Executive that now, more than ever, tech clients are hiring in a more distributional manner across the nation and world. Not surprisingly, their real estate portfolios mirror their talent strategies, and are likewise more distributed, he said. As employees become more distributed, it is crucial to learn, for each location, how many people are coming back to the office and their commutation patterns. Where they live is crucial to finding the right office space, according to Steven Rotter, vice chairman, brokerage, at JLL. A lot has changed where, before COVID, people were saying Hey I want to be in Chelsea or I need to be in Union Square because thats the cool place for tech companies and now it has changed to Lets look at other things that will take priority, Rotter told CPE. Spaces fit for a tech client So, what are the priorities today for tech clients? First, Ogelsby says, its flexibility and agility within the tech clients leased portfolio. In recent weeks, many of the big tech companies have announced they are downsizing their workforces through layoffs and that will impact occupancy decisions for some. A lot of activity in the tech sector entails building out subleases or fully amenitized serviced offices, explained Ogelsby. Both options traditionally offer shorter term lengths and typically minimize any upfront capital expense. Meanwhile, tech companies are redefining their standards for space. In 2019, a year when virtually every tech company was hiring and expanding, according to Rotter, tech clients sought gritty buildings with exposed ceilings. These spaces accommodated as many employees as possible, while inspiring creativity and culture creation. Location and quality was less important, but that is no longer the case. Everything has transitioned, and it is called the flight to quality, said Rotter. People are very focused at finding a much better building in a better location. While employees and employers are still struggling to work out the perfect remote, hybrid, or in-office work structure, many tech companies are hoping that the right location will get their employees excited to come to come to the office. Buildings with more amenities, including kitchen and coffee spaces as well as separate meeting rooms and co-working areas are faring well. Other boxes tech clients are looking to check off include outdoor space and easy transportation access. These companies are willing to pay more for exactly what their employees need. Hot spots for tech this year Due to a series of venture capital firms moving out of what used to be the primary tech hot spots, such as San Francisco, and the difficulty off getting people back into the office in these cities, newer markets around the nation are growing in tech presence. Nashville, New York, Boston, Miami have been fortunate enough to really grow the tech industry, and I think that is going to continue, said Rotter. And, while activity may be slowing in Austin, Bellevue and other hubs, tech companies are still working to establish their global footprints. I think we will continue to see activity increase in emerging markets many in India, LATAM and EMEA, as examples, Oglesby said. As for the Bay Area, he thinks leasing could pick up there this year as tech companies settle on new workplace policies. But, the truth of the matter is that tech clients, like most companies, are in cost-containment mode. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer, ultimately the real estate priorities mirror the business objectives, Ogelsby told CPE.",

    "body": "PayPal headquarters office at 2211 N. First Street in San Jose, 2019. (Google Maps) By George Avalos | February 2, 2023 at 8:56 a.m. | UPDATED: February 2, 2023 at 8:59 a.m. SAN JOSE  PayPal has revealed plans for a fresh round of job cuts in San Jose, a staffing reduction that serves as a disquieting sign that the Bay Areas tech layoffs have yet to run their course. The digital payments giant intends to eliminate more than 300 jobs at the tech companys head offices in north San Jose, according to an official notice that PayPal has sent to state labor officials. PayPal is undertaking restructuring activity that will result in employee exits, the company stated in a Jan. 31 letter that it sent to the Employment Development Department. The company has decided to eliminate the jobs of 319 people who work at the companys San Jose headquarters complex at 2211 North First Street, the WARN notice stated. The most recent PayPal job cuts mean that the company has disclosed plans to cut 378 jobs in the Bay Area, all in San Jose. About two months ago, PayPal filed a WARN notice sketching out a decision to cut 59 jobs in San Jose, effective in November 2022. The PayPal cutbacks could require several weeks to complete, the WARN notice stated. The layoffs began on Jan. 31 and could continue through March 31, PayPal told the EDD. The notifications of terminations will occur on a rolling basis, PayPal stated in the WARN letter. PayPal added that the terminations will be permanent. San Jose-based PayPal on Jan. 31 announced that it would cut 2,000 jobs worldwide, which equated to 7% of the companys workforce. PayPal is just one of the numerous high-profile tech companies that in recent months have disclosed plans for wide-ranging job cuts. Amazon has said it plans to cut 18,000 workers worldwide. Google owner Alphabet has revealed a decision to cut 12,000 positions globally. Facebook app owner Meta Platforms has unveiled plans to chop 11,000 jobs around the world. Microsoft said it was eliminating 10,000 workers globally. Hewlett-Packard said it planned to chop 4,000 to 6,000 jobs over the next three years. Other high-profile tech companies that are planning or have conducted job cuts in recent months include Twitter, Salesforce and Cisco Systems. The impact in the Bay Area is significant. Since July 2022, these tech or biotech companies have revealed decisions to eliminate at least 500 jobs in the nine-county region, based on the WARN letters they have sent to the EDD for completed or upcoming layoffs: Meta Platforms: 2,464 job cuts affecting workers in Menlo Park, San Francisco, Fremont, Sunnyvale and Burlingame. Google: 1,608 layoffs impacting employees in Mountain View, Moffett Field, San Bruno and Palo Alto. Cepheid: 925 positions terminated in Newark and Sunnyvale. Twitter: 900 job cuts in San Francisco and San Jose. Salesforce: 752 jobs eliminated in San Francisco. Invitae: 736 positions cut in San Francisco. Cisco Systems: 673 layoffs in San Jose, Milpitas and San Francisco Hello Fresh: 611 positions terminated in Richmond Amazon: 524 job cuts in Sunnyvale and San Francisco. In a letter sent to employees, PayPal Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman stated that the company over a period of months has attempted to restructure itself. Over the past year, we made significant progress in strengthening and reshaping our company to address the challenging macro-economic environment while continuing to invest to meet our customers needs, Schulman said. We have more work to do. That additional effort is in the form of wide-ranging layoffs, Schulman stated in the open letter. We must continue to change as our world, our customers, and our competitive landscape evolve, Schulman said.",

I don't walk as much after dinner in the neighborhood when we used to enjoy a stroll. While traditional personal protection gear such as mace and pepper spray have been popular in the past, they are illegal in certain states and difficult to get through airport security.Additionally, carrying a defensive device that can be used as a weapon can create more danger, especially if it falls into the wrong hands. As important as it is to keep safe, it's equally important that protective tech is portable and easily integrated into one's life so it can be readily on hand. The following is a list of safety tech gear that is both discreet and safe.

    "body": "Email The Old Dominion Monarchs have adjusted their 2023 football schedule and added three Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) opponents to their future football schedules, the school announced on Thursday. Old Dominion was previously scheduled to host the Buffalo Bulls on Sept. 23, 2023. However, the schools have mutually agreed to cancel the game and it will not be rescheduled. The Monarchs have replaced the Buffalo contest with a home tilt against the Texas A&M-Commerce Lions of the Southland Conference in the FCS. The ODU-Texas A&M-Commerce game will be played on Sept. 23 at S.B. Ballard Stadium in Norfolk, Va. Old Dominion did not have an FCS opponent on their non-conference schedule in 2023, which allowed them to add the contest. The Old Dominion-Buffalo game was canceled so that the Bulls could play at the Louisiana Ragin Cajuns next season. Louisiana was the only Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) team remaining with a non-conference opening in 2023 and likely did not want to schedule a second FCS opponent. In addition to the changes to their 2023 football schedule, Old Dominion has announced the addition of future games against North Carolina Central, Norfolk State, and William & Mary. ODU will host North Carolina Central on Sept. 6, 2025, which completes the Monarchs non-conference slate that season. The Monarchs will also visit Indiana (Aug. 30) and Virginia Tech (Sept. 13) host Liberty (Oct. 4). The Norfolk State Spartans will make the short, four-mile trip to play Old Dominion on Sept. 5, 2026. Other non-conference opponents for the Monarchs that season include Virginia Tech on the road on Sept. 12 and UConn at home on Oct. 31. Old Dominion will host William & Mary in Norfolk on Sept. 1, 2029. That completes the schedule for Old Dominion that season, which also includes contests at Army on Sept. 8, at East Carolina Sept. 15, and a home against Virginia Tech on Sept. 22.",

    "body": "Medha Singh The logo of Meta Platforms' business group is seen in Brussels, Belgium December 6, 2022. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Feb 2 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) shares rose about 23% on Thursday and helped spark a rally in the technology sector after the Facebook owner floored Wall Street by slashing its spending forecast and boosting its stock buyback plan by $40 billion. The company was set to add more than $90 billion to its market value and was on course to log its best day in a decade. The rally also lifted shares of Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), all of which sport valuations of more than $1 trillion and will report earnings after market close. Meta's move on Wednesday to rein in costs marked a dramatic shift for a company that has spent billions of dollars to turn its vision of the futuristic metaverse into a reality, even while its core business reeled from stiff competition and a weak advertising market. At least 24 analysts boosted their price targets on the stock after the results, with several saying that a combination of lower costs, upbeat revenue growth and share buybacks will drive up Meta's earnings per share. Latest Updates Gallery View 2 more stories \"That is rare,\" analysts at Evercorse ISI said, referring to the positive developments. \"And stocks react to rare.\" The results also provided some relief to the market after an earnings meltdown at Snap Inc (SNAP.N) on Tuesday that had sent tech shares lower. \"After Snap's disaster, the fact that Meta wasn't quite so bad has brought encouragement to tech mega-caps,\" said Fiona Cincotta, analyst at City Index. \"There is also a less hawkish Fed (Federal Reserve), which is also boosting demand for growth and tech stocks generally.\" 'YEAR OF EFFICIENCY' Meta now expects its 2023 expenses between $89 billion and $95 billion, a sharp drop from its previous outlook of $94 billion to $100 billion, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling the period a \"Year of Efficiency.\" The forecast reflects savings from the 11,000 job cuts it announced in November, plans for lower data-center construction expenses and moves to drop non-crucial projects. \"Promising that 2023 will be a year of efficiency was always likely to go down well with investors concerned about the largesse in spending directed towards the unproven potential of the metaverse,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. There were also signs that Meta's core social-media business was getting back on track, with monetization efficiency for short-form video Reels on Facebook doubling and the business being on track to break-even as soon as end of 2023. The company, which forecast first-quarter revenue above market estimates, also said that Facebook's daily active user base grew to 2 billion, from 1.98 billion in the prior quarter. \"Meta is getting its mojo back,\" analysts at Baird said.

    "description": "These players have the most riding on their performances at the Senior Bowl",
    "body": "Senior Bowl , there's never any questions about facing less than top competition. The all-star event provides an awesome opportunity for prospects to showcase their skills against the best senior talent entering the NFL Draft. Without fail, every year, a handful of players rise boards while others see their stock drop due to what transpires on the field during practices and the game held in Mobile, Alabama. Who has the most to gain this week? What about the most to lose? Let's examine. Most To Gain Keion White, EDGE, Georgia Tech White is an oversized defensive end with first-round pass-rusher flashes. But that's just it -- consistency wasn't a staple of his game at Georgia Tech. At the Senior Bowl, one-on-one battles between defensive linemen and blockers are all the rage, and they usually favor the defenders given how much space there is to operate. This event is primed for White to flourish and drop jaws of evaluators while doing so given his thickness, power, and hand-work talent. Tyson Bagent, QB, Shepherd This is a down quarterback class for the Senior Bowl. Period. That means Bagent, the quarterback from Division II Shepherd, has a magnificent chance to seize some eyes of scouts and media members more so than one from a lower-level passer would. At just under 6-3 and almost 220 pounds, Bagent is one of the largest quarterbacks in Mobile this week. Dylan Horton, EDGE, TCU Horton remarkably managed 48 pressures on just over 400 pass-rush snaps in 2022 despite predominantly rushing as an end in a three-man front in TCU's famed 3-3-5 defense. There were not many opportunities from a wide alignment for the sleek, 6-foot-4, nearly 260-pound rusher. In Mobile, Horton will be given more opportunities to rush the passer -- even in one-on-ones -- in a more classic sense. That opportunity alone makes Horton an easy selection here. Andrei Iosivas, WR, Princeton Any Ivy League Senior Bowl participant will get the nod from me in this section every year. Iosivas is precisely the type of prospect who makes the Senior Bowl such an awesome event. We know he rocked against Ivy League competition, as he had over 100 grabs and 1,600 yards with 12 receiving touchdowns over the past two seasons. Now let's see how he fares against NFL talent from the Power 5 conferences. At nearly 6-foot-3 and 212 pounds with serious vertical speed, Iosivas has NFL-caliber size and speed. Andre Carter II, EDGE, Army Carter was as unblockable as Aidan Hutchinson in 2021. No question about it. Carter tallied 59 pressures on just 293 pass-rushing snaps, good for a ridiculous 20.1% pressure-creation rate. Then, in 2022, defenses dedicated copious amounts of attention to him on Army's defensive line. Doubles and chips galore. Carter still generated a pressure 13.2% of the time. At 6-foot-6 and 252 pounds with vines for arms, there's plenty to like from a physical perspective with Carter. If he can collapse the pocket like he did in 2021, he'll cement himself in the first round. He's that talented. Evan Hull, RB, Northwestern Hull hardly felt the spotlight in 2022 on a 1-11 Northwestern team after a rocky 3-9 campaign the year before. But if wins aren't a quarterback stat, then they certainly aren't a running back stat. Hull is an absolute joy to watch on film. Sudden, choppy steps, outstanding vision, impressive contact balance, and exceptional comfort as a receiver -- Hull's game was tailor-made for the NFL in Evanston, Illinois. I'm looking forward to watching him operate among top-tier talent at the Senior Bowl. Luke Musgrave, TE, Oregon State Musgrave flies, erupts and explodes down the football field. Use whatever similar word you'd like. And he's not one of those tall receivers masquerading as a tight end, either. At over 6-foot-5 and 255 pounds, he has serious NFL tight end size. He's featured in this portion of the article because the Oregon State star only played in two games in 2022 due to a knee injury, which apparently he's completely recovered from because he's taken part -- and demonstrated his blazing speed -- during the first two days of practice in Mobile. Most To Lose Jammie Robinson, DB, Florida State Robinson played a unique, safety-linebacker role at Florida State and looked tremendously fast to the football his entire career with the Seminoles. At under 5-foot-11 and 194 pounds, he's actually on the small side for the safety spot, particularly if he's going to roam in the box as a nickel linebacker or strong safety. Robinson will have to be very dynamic during team work and the game itself to provide some evidence to scouts and GMs that he can live in the box at the next level. Max Duggan, QB, TCU Duggan had a remarkable season at TCU; we all know that. He launched on-target long balls all season and was arguably the toughest quarterback in college football in the open field or even in the pocket. Took plenty of hits and continued to get up. He won't necessarily be able to show off his trademark ruggedness at the Senior Bowl, and at 6-foot-1 and 204 pounds, the TCU icon doesn't have the body typically thought to handle that type of beating in the NFL. Elijah Higgins, WR, Stanford The Senior Bowl favors small, quick-twitch route-running extraordinaires, particularly in the receiver-cornerback one-on-one drills. Of course, during the week of practices, there's not tackling to the ground. At 6-foot-3 and nearly 230 pounds, Higgins' greatest selling point as a prospect is his large running back frame and contact balance he showcases after the catch. This isn't really an event made for his type at the receiver spot.

    "body": "WhatsApp Reddit With foreign exchange reserves of just $3.68 billion, Pakistan has barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports| Photo Credit:AKHTAR SOOMRO Our Pakistani neighbours are staring into an economic abyss with the rupee in free-fall, inflation soaring and energy running short. Thats why so much hangs on an IMF teams visit this week to Islamabad to discuss unlocking a vital loan programme. But that effort is already in trouble. The IMF now says it wants not just the government but all political parties on board for a deal. Given the bad blood between Prime Minister Shebhaz Sharif and his predecessor, Imran Khan, whos angling to return to power in looming national elections, that may be a tall order. Khan has conceded Pakistan needs the bailout. But the IMF may still be sceptical given that the ex-cricketer torpedoed the last IMF package by backing out of his word to slash subsidies. In Pakistan, for the moment, the IMF talks have been pushed out of the news by the suicide-bombing deaths of over 101 people, mainly policemen, in a mosque inside a police headquarters in violence-torn Peshawar. But as the shock of that attack recedes, Pakistans focus will again return to the economy. Rupee falling Economists say Pakistans never been this close to default. Just a few days ago, the Pakistan rupee was at 231 to the US dollar. Now its at 269. With foreign exchange reserves of just $3.68 billion, Pakistan has barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports. Nasir Iqbal, of Pakistans Institute of Development Economics, says the economy has already virtually collapsed amid political upheaval. One IMF demand is for the rupee to float and find its own level, which would drive up import costs  and Pakistan imports almost everything it consumes. So, a falling rupee means people feel pain for almost everything they buy and inflation is already running at nearly 28 per cent, a 48-year high. Also, the government has decided one way to stop the dollar outflow is not to release foreign exchange. That means companies like Pakistan Suzuki had to halt production in late December as they couldnt import parts. Motorbike production has just restarted and demand has risen, partly from people who feel they can only afford two-wheelers. Pakistans central bank did, however, release foreign exchange to import 2,200 luxury cars in the last six months, stoking huge public anger. Shabbar Zaidi, ex-chairman of Pakistans Federal Board of Revenue, remarked direly that Pakistans insatiable desire for status quo had made the nervous system of the Pakistani economy dysfunctional. In other words, the elite still want their luxury cars and are unwilling to tighten their belts. The government has moved on another IMF demand, and this week hiked petrol and diesel prices by Pak 35. Kerosene prices climbed by Pak 18. Electricity prices, too, were increased in parts of the country  and thats coming just a few days after a second power outage in two months plunged the nation into darkness. Pakistan has just inaugurated a $2.7-billion nuclear reactor financed by China that should relieve some pressure on the countrys stretched electricity grid. Adding to Pakistans woes, lets not forget its still struggling to recover from last years worst-ever devastating floods. Textile sector badly hit Also badly hit is the textile industry and at least 150 plants have closed because they cant import dye. Textiles are one of the biggest employers, so around a million workers could be either fully or partly laid off as a result. Inevitably, industrial production has fallen steeply in recent weeks, possibly by up to 25 per cent. One estimate is that around 6,000 containers are stuck in Karachi Port because importers cant get the foreign exchange to pay for their release. That bottleneck is stoking inflation. Even exporters cant get the letters of credit required before consignments are accepted. If somehow a deal with the IMF is clinched, the loan is expected to total $6.5 billion with slightly over $1 billion coming almost immediately. The UAE and Saudi Arabia will also send financial assistance once the package is tied up. (China, which has its own problems, is hanging back.) But even this sum will be barely enough to see Pakistan through the next few months and is a stopgap solution at best to its larger problems. By June, Pakistan will have uncovered repayments of $8 billion. So, most of the loans will go to paying off creditors. For years, Pakistans politicians have operated on the premise the nuclear-armed country is so geopolitically vital, a rescue will materialise. But with the world in crisis over Ukraine and the global economy slowing, a last-minute miracle may not be in the cards.",

    "description": "The Bank of England also said while the UK was heading for recession, it may be shorter and shallower than previously expected",
    "body": "Privacy Notice The hit to the UK economy from Brexit is coming through faster than had previously been expected, the Bank of England deputy governor has said. Ben Broadbent said it was still not clear whether the effects of EU withdrawal were a reason why the UK is forecast to do worse than other major economies this year. His comments follow a warning by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Britain alone of the leading economies is expected to contract this year. Labour said it underlined the needed for the UK to build a new trading relationship with its closest neighbour and trading partner. Speaking at a press conference following the Banks latest interest rate hike, Mr Broadbent, the deputy governor for monetary policy, said they had not changed their overall assessment of the economic impact of Brexit. He acknowledged, however, that they had not expected to see the effect on growth figures to come through quite so quickly. Brexit  has been something that has pulled on our potential output in our country and thats been our assessment for many years, he said. Weve not changed our estimate of the long-running effects, but weve brought some of them forward and we think theyre probably coming in faster than we first expected. He added: Yes it (Brexit) is having some effect on growth, although ultimately no bigger effect than we assessed some years ago. Based on the numbers for trade and some degree for the numbers on investment, we think these effects are coming through faster than initially envisaged. Overall, the Bank said that while it believed the UK was still heading for a recession, the downturn may be shorter and shallower than previously expected. The Governor, Andrew Bailey, said Brexit was one of a series of significant economic shocks to have had an impact along with the Covid pandemic and Russias invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing rise in energy costs. These shocks have held back both productivity and labour supply, he said. For Labour, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest figures showed the UK needed to build bridges with Brussels. We do need to improve our trading relationship and the deal that we have with the European Union because the numbers today on exports, on investment  we need to turn that around, she told BBC Radio 4s The World At One. We want a stronger, more productive relationship with our nearest neighbours and trading partners. Story Saved",

    "body": "LIVE: Decoding Union Budget 2023 & The Adani Saga With Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC One, few days ago, the IMF said that the world economy may skirt a recession, as it revised its growth forecast from 2.7 per cent in October to 2.9 per cent  for 2023. Two, factors such as strong jobs data, household consumption and business investment in the US are still robust, although lower than a few months ago. Fed Chair Jay Powells statement that while the bank would be watchful, This article by Anubhav Sahu discusses implications of the Feds rate hike and other recent US data. Three, Chinas re-opening along with reducing fears of war in Europe and the ebbing of the pandemic, are set to revive international trade. In other words, domestic growth and exports may tango sooner than later, to favour overall growth in Indias Amrit Kaal journey. But this is not to say that its a sweet journey ahead for India and investors in Indian financial markets. Note that Indian market valuations are still stretched , even after the hard fall, on Wednesday. Further, an improving global outlook means that the growth premium enjoyed by the Indian market will reduce, says Sahu in the article. This could actually re-set emerging market (EM) fund flows, even as a lower dollar index augurs well for EMs in comparison to developed markets. For now, Indian indices are reeling under negative sentiment perpetrated by the rout in Adani group stocks that have seen a US$100 billion erosion over a week, forcing the billionaire Gautam Adani to recall his Rs20,000 crore Follow on Public Offer (FPO). Of course, market veterans, do not seem perturbed, given that such events would soon be pushed to the side lines. So for investors, it's time to focus on corporate fundamentals and earnings. For those of you who may want to delve deeper into the Union Budget, todays edition has several articles (listed below) analysing the fine print, some hits and misses. An interesting insight on the FMs approach is in Sashi Sivramkrishnas article, where some parts of the Budget are apparently based on the Washington Consensus. The Indian government believes that the growth of the economy, through a trickle-down process, will lead to lower unemployment. Only time will tell, whether this will hold good.

    "body": "February 02, 2023 19:53:51 IST Representational image. In the Union Budget 2023-24, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has finally found a place. The FM, during her Budget speech, outlined that India will embark on a vision called Make AI in India and Make AI work for India. As part of this vision, Sitharaman proposed the establishment of centres of excellence dedicated to AI that will pop up in the countrys top educational institutions. The minister also declared that leading industry players would collaborate to do multidisciplinary research, create cutting-edge software, and find scalable solutions to issues in sustainable agriculture, health, and urban planning. This will energize a powerful AI ecosystem and nurture top human resources in the industry. The minister has placed significant importance on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive the digitalisation of the Indian economy. The allocation of funds towards AI research and development, and the setting up of a National Artificial Intelligence Portal are clear indicators of the governments commitment to making India a leader in AI. The allocation of Rs 2,000 crore to the National Research Foundation (NRF) is a positive step in this direction. The NRF is expected to support cutting-edge research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including AI. This investment will go a long way in fostering an ecosystem for AI research and development in India and will provide a much-needed boost to the countrys AI talent pool. Moreover, the creation of the National Artificial Intelligence Portal is expected to serve as a single-window platform for AI-related information and resources, including data sets, models, and tools. This will not only make AI research and development more accessible but also help in the creation of AI-based solutions for various sectors of the economy, such as HR tech, fintech, health tech, and edtech. AI is also expected to drive the digitalisation of the Indian economy, which is crucial for the countrys growth and competitiveness in the global market. It has the potential to transform various sectors of the economy and improve efficiency and effectiveness. For example, in agriculture, AI can be used to increase crop yields, reduce wastage, and improve supply chain management. In the HR tech sector, AI can bring several benefits by providing organizations with new and innovative solutions to address their HR needs. By leveraging AI-powered tools, organizations can improve their HR processes, engage, and retain their employees, and minimise the risk of compliance and legal issues. Challenges to implementation The implementation of AI-based solutions in India faces several challenges, such as a lack of skilled manpower, limited access to data, and a lack of infrastructure. The governments weight on AI in the Union Budget 2023 is expected to address some of these challenges and provide the necessary support for the growth of the AI sector in India. The Union Budget 2023-24 took a positive step towards the digitalisation of the Indian economy and made India a leader in AI. The allocation of funds towards AI research and development, the creation of the National Artificial Intelligence Portal, and the investment in the National Research Foundation are expected to drive the growth of the AI sector in India and help address some of the challenges faced by the implementation of AI-based solutions. The emphasis on AI is expected to lead to increased efficiency and effectiveness in various sectors of the economy and drive economic growth. Though the Union Budget aims to accelerate the sectors growth,  the corporate sector still has mixed sentiments because the government has not complied with its demands for tax breaks. Having said that, the industry can see the other side of the coin and proceed on a growth trajectory if the announced Budget is immediately allocated and put into action.

    "body": "Share URL Copied Tunisian street cleaner Lassad Mejri says life has grown so tough for his family because of the countrys dire economy that they prepare just one meal a day, but as government finances falter, there may be worse to come. Like many Tunisians Mejri, 57, and his wife Elgeya had already been struggling to cope with basic living costs before recent years brought the COVID-19 pandemic, rising global inflation and a crisis in state finances. Advertisement For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app. People are no longer happy and cannot even laugh. Everything is difficult. If you laugh now, you feel bad, said Mejri, who lives in the town of Tebourba, 30km (18 miles) west of the capital Tunis. Mejri, his wife, and their son used to eat three meals a day. Now, Elgeya only prepares a midday meal and they only eat in the evening if there are leftovers. Mejri spends his working days sweeping streets and pavements in Tebourba, pushing a wheeled plastic bin along with him, to earn 400 dinars ($100) a month. Everything has become very expensive this year, we can no longer buy anything, he said. Tunisia has been pushing for years for an international bailout to help it stave off bankruptcy, but the countrys political turmoil and disputes over economic reforms have thwarted those efforts. Last week, ratings agency Moodys downgraded Tunisian sovereign debt, saying there was a likelihood of a default. Shortages of some subsidised food and medicine already point to the governments economic problems, and a default would likely make things much worse by raising the cost of borrowing and undermining the dinar, which would worsen inflation. Mejri needs medicine for a medical condition, but said he was no longer able to find it in Tunisia. Its not a shortage. This medicine is not here anymore, he said. He said he managed to obtain some from a woman who had imported it specially from France for her own mother. Shortages have been seen across the country, with supermarkets and local shops out of some products or having to ration basic goods such as sugar, milk, butter and cooking oil. Even without those shortages, a 10 percent inflation rate - which economists say may be 20 percent for food items - means many Tunisians are buying less anyway. At a Tunis market, vegetable seller Tawfik Mselmi, 53, said he was ashamed to be demanding such high prices, but was making no profit. People look at the peppers and tomatoes and do not buy them. Or they buy two peppers and two tomatoes, he said.

    "body": "The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly dropped last week, falling to the lowest level in nine months. Figures released Thursday by the Labor Department show initial claims for the week ended Jan. 28 fell to 183,000 from the unrevised 186,000 recorded a week earlier. That is below the 2019 pre-pandemic average of 218,000 claims and is the lowest since April 2022. Continuing claims, filed by Americans who are consecutively receiving unemployment benefits, fell slightly to 1.65 million for the week ended Jan. 21, a decrease of 11,000 from the previous week. One year ago, nearly 1.89 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits. JOB OPENINGS UNEXPECTEDLY SURGE TO 11 MILLION IN DECEMBER  The labor market remains a bright spot in the economy, but there are some early signs that it is beginning to soften. The economy added just 223,000 jobs in December, the smallest gain in two years. A plethora of big tech companies, including Amazon and Microsoft, have also announced thousands of job cuts in recent weeks as they brace for a possible recession. The economy is slowing as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates at the fastest pace in decades in order to crush runaway inflation. Although the labor market is still healthy, both the housing and manufacturing sectors are weakening and inflation remains painfully high.  US COMPANIES OFFERING RECORD-HIGH RAISES TO RETAIN WORKERS, KEEPING PRESSURE ON INFLATION Policymakers have already approved eight consecutive rate increases and signaled at the conclusion of their two-day meeting on Wednesday that additional hikes are on the table this year as they try to cool the economy  and the labor market. Fed officials have made it clear that they expect unemployment to climb as a result of higher rates, which could force consumers and businesses to pull back on spending.  \"I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market,\" Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday. \"But I would also say that the disinflationary process that you now see underway is really at an early stage.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Projections from the central bank's December meeting show that officials expect unemployment to rise to 4.5% by the end of next year, up from the current rate of 3.5%. That could mean more than 1 million Americans lose their jobs between now and the end of 2023.",

He is a Hall of Fame cornerback who has won multiple Super Bowls with multiple teams and is one of the most electric players of his era.Sanders made the transition from player to college coach in 2020 when he took over as head coach of the Jackson State Tigers.After three successful seasons, Deion Sanders was offered the opportunity for the head coaching position of the Colorado Buffaloes on December 3, 2022, and took it to become their next head coach.Many sports personalities thought it was a great landing for the Buffaloes, who have had six-straight losing seasons. \"Undisputed\" analyst Skip Bayless, who covered Sanders as a player in Dallas, is buying into Deion Sanders at Colorado.Bayless said:\"So, you know this man veryT well.

    "body": "says he is relieved after charges of attempted rape and assault against the Manchester United forward were dropped. Greenwood was arrested in January 2022 amid allegations surrounding images and videos that surfaced on social media. The England footballer was later charged with attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service said the charges were discontinued after key witnesses withdrew their involvement. In a short statement following the announcement, Greenwood said: I am relieved that this matter is now over and I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support. There will be no further comment at this time. Greenwood has scored 35 goals in 129 appearances for Manchester United since making his first-team debut in 2019. Greenwood is still suspended by Manchester United (Picture: PA) He made his England debut a year later and was named in Gareth Southgates squad for Euro 2020 but pulled out due to an underlying injury. Premier League club Manchester United say they will now carry out an internal investigation, with Greenwood still currently suspended and not able to return to training until the process is complete. The club will now conduct its own process before determining next steps, they said in a statement. We will not make any further comment until that process is complete. Explaining why the charges against Greenwood were dropped, a Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said: We have a duty to keep cases under continuous review. In this case a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case. We have explained our decision to all parties. We would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met. The 21-year-old was arrested in January 2022 (Picture: Getty) Ch Supt Michaela Kerr from Greater Manchester Police, meanwhile, added: This decision has not been taken lightly. I would, however, like to use this opportunity to reiterate the forces commitment to investigating allegations of violence against women and girls and supporting those affected, regardless of their circumstances, throughout what can be a hard and upsetting time for them. Greenwood joined Manchester United at the age of six and spent more than a decade in the clubs academy before breaking into the first-team. MORE :",

    "description": "Tracey Crouch conducted a fan-led review when she was Sports Minister and now the Government is due to publish a detailed White Paper on new legislation for football",
    "body": "comments Tracey Crouch has welcomed positive news about a new independent regulator for English football. Former Sports Minister Crouch, who conducted a fan-led review, has championed stronger rules and a greater share of cash throughout the football pyramid. Fans could be given a golden share so they are party to decision in the future in the wake of the European Super League to stop secret breakaways happening again. The Government is due to publish a detailed White Paper on new legislation for football but it seems clear that Ministers are now pushing ahead with plans as it had been in serious doubt. EFL outline financial demands to Premier League clubs to scrap FA Cup replays Crouch said: I havent seen the details yet of the White Paper, but the indications are positive that the government will introduce an independent regulator via legislation with backstop powers on financial redistribution. While it may be the case that some recommendations from the fan-led review are not going to be implemented, arguably, the most important ones are. From what Ive read, it looks like the government has accepted and will act on the fundamental recommendation of introducing an independent regulator underpinned by legislation. EFL and Premier League bosses have had discussions about trying to find a compromise on things like a levy on transfers being paid out. Tracey Crouch has praised the news ( Image: PA) There have also been calls for greater controls of ownership and takeovers but the White Paper may not cover that, leaving it up to the Premier League and EFL to decide. The regulator was in danger under Lizz Truss as Prime Minister as it was thought she was not in favour but Rishi Sunak now appears to be giving the go-ahead. Football Supporters Association chair Kevin Miles welcomed the idea of stronger tests on potential club owners, more supporter engagement, blocks on breakaway competitions like the European Super League and the establishment of an independent regulator. Miles added: We look forward to seeing the full white paper upon its release and, once again, we will enthusiastically and constructively engage with the consultation process to ensure that the regulator becomes as effective as possible.

    "body": "Amad Diallo has played nine times for Man Utd since joining from Atalanta in 2021 (Picture: Getty) Paul Parker has warned Amad Diallo about returning to parent club Manchester United. Manchester United news, exclusives and analysisSign upPrivacy Policy The 20-year-old versatile attacker is on a season-long loan at Championship side Sunderland, who are currently two points off the play-offs as they look to make a return to the Premier League. Diallo has registered seven goals and an assist across 21 Championship games for the Black Cats this term and was named the EFL Young Player of the Month in December in what has been an impressive spell for the youngster. Erik ten Hag considered recalling Diallo from his loan at Sunderland but had reservations about disrupting his form. Former United defender Parker rates Diallo highly but feels the Ivory Coast international should stay at Sunderland and continue his development for as long as possible after struggling at Scottish club Rangers in a previous loan spell. He is a very smart player, Parker told SpilXperten about Diallo. I have seen all his goals and assists, and he moves cleverly on the pitch. He had an extremely difficult time at Rangers because its a completely different way of playing football in Scotland.  \thttps://www.instagram.com/p/Cn7NMMysEYF/?hl=en It was a really bad idea for him to ever go to Rangers just because his agent wanted him to play for a big club. But I still think the stay has benefited him mentally and thats maybe why hes playing so well for Sunderland.  Every time he descends into a black hole in the future, he just has to think about how awful it was at Rangers. It was a good lesson. However, it makes no sense for him to come back to Manchester United just yet. There are so many wingers at the club that its like being in a doctors waiting room.  The next one is constantly ready in the queue, so he should stay at Sunderland for an extra year.

Manchester United news, exclusives and analysisSign upPrivacy Policy Dalot returned from the World Cup in Qatar carrying a knock, allowing Aaron Wan-Bissaka to force his way back into the side. The Portugal international subsequently limped off in the 3-0 win over Charlton in the Carabao Cup, missing his sides next six games as a result. The 23-year-old was absent from the squad again as United sealed their place in the final of that competition against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday, thanks to a 5-0 aggregate win. Jadon Sancho and Anthony Martial made their returns to the side in that victory with Fernandes believing competition for places will now intensify in the coming weeks. We are really happy for the team that it gets more and more players fit, Fernandes said. Diogo is training also with us and will probably be fully fit really soon and that is really good because the manager has more options. Sancho returned to action on Wednesday night (Picture: Getty) Sancho made his first appearance since October following an extended period away from the squad, with Erik ten Hag revealing in December the England international did not feel physically or mentally fit. The former Borussia Dortmund was seen smiling as he received a huge ovation from the Old Trafford crowd after coming off the bench against Forest with Fernandes welcoming his return. Hes been really good. As I said to him, its great to have him back because we know he is a massive solution for us, as a starter, as someone to come and have great qualities to help the team. We all know the capacity that he has. He hasnt expressed it at his best yet, hes been at some moments really good. Obviously now he is back from a long period but we are really happy to have him back, as the same with Anthony Martial coming back from injury. \t \t \tMORE : Manchester United are revived under Erik ten Hags quiet authority \t \t \t \t \tMORE : Louis Saha suggests Harry Maguire should have left Manchester United on loan in January \t \t For more stories like this,check our sport page.

Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis Sign up Privacy Policy Earlier on Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed that charges of attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm have been dropped against the 21-year-old. Greenwood was arrested last January and was set to face trial in November before the charges were dropped. The England international, who has a contract with United until June 2025, has not played for his club since his arrest. A statement from United on Thursday read:  Manchester United notes the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service that all charges against Mason Greenwood have been dropped. The club will now conduct its own process before determining next steps. We will not make any further comment until that process is complete. Mason Greenwood arriving at court last November (PA) A spokesperson for the CPS said on Thursday: We have a duty to keep cases under continuous review. In this case a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case. We have explained our decision to all parties. We would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met. More: Roy Keane praises Erik ten Hag for getting rid of FOUR 'energy-sapping' Man Utd stars Chief Superintendent Michaela Kerr, Greater Manchester Polices head of public protection, said: The investigation team has remained in regular contact with the legal team, providing any updates of note, and so understand the rationale for the discontinuation of proceedings at this stage, and that this decision has not been taken lightly. Despite the media and publics interest in this case, we have decided not to comment on it in any further detail. I would, however, like to use this opportunity to reiterate GMPs commitment to investigating allegations of violence against women and girls and supporting those affected, regardless of their circumstances, throughout what can be a hard and upsetting time for them. An ever increasing number of officers are receiving specialist training and the force is more consistently utilising tools, available via the criminal justice system, to keep people safe and care for victims.

    "description": "Green Football Weekend raises awkward questions about the games readiness to start taking genuinely ambitious action",
    "body": "Thu 2 Feb 2023 12.23 EST Last modified on Thu 2 Feb 2023 12.26 EST A bout three years ago, in the thick of a League Two promotion campaign, Michael Doughty began to notice something. An unusually wet winter had flooded Swindon Towns training pitches, forcing them to trek up and down the country in search of a usable facility. The postponements were piling up. It would be unseasonably warm, then super-cold, which made performance more difficult, he remembers. The effect was really tangible. And I couldnt understand why there wasnt a discussion. For Doughty it was a realisation that would set off an unusual chain of events. After retiring from the game he set up a sustainable sportswear brand, but soon realised that he wanted to work in football again. And so, aged just 30, he has returned to his old club, not as a coach or a scout or an ambassador, but as their chief sustainability officer: the first former player to take such a position at an English league club. Read more There are big plans. Swindon are about to secure the purchase of the County Ground from the local council for the first time, allowing them to redevelop the ground with an environmental focus. A new roof on the Stratton Bank stand will be fitted with solar panels, and there will be electric charging points in the car park. But first, there are small plans: the job of convincing supporters and sponsors that a 144-year-old football club can and must play a role in the future of the planet. This is where Doughty comes in. Hes at pains to stress that hes not a scientist or a climate expert. But he is a club legend, part of their League Two title-winning side of 2020, and when youre trying to change minds that counts for something. I can relate to the fans, he says. I didnt retire 50 years ago. I was part of good times at the club. And making the world of sustainability slightly more emotional will help people come on the journey with us. And it is a journey, one that English football is slowly setting in motion, albeit at wildly varying speeds. Not every club can be a Forest Green, with its wooden stadium and all-vegan menu. This weekend is Green Football Weekend, one of those initiatives with a shiny website and a hashtag and a mixture of the well-meaning and faintly gimmicky. Middlesbrough are planting a tree for every goal they score against Blackpool. Wolves are wearing green armbands against Liverpool. Its that sort of vibe. I couldnt understand why there wasnt a discussion. Michael Doughty, Swindon Towns chief sustainability officer. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Which feels like a good moment to ask a few questions. Given what we know about the climate emergency, its scale and its urgency, what evidence is there that English football is taking this remotely seriously? What would it take for the countrys biggest sport to move beyond green armbands and hashtags, and start acting with genuine speed and genuine ambition? And what would that action even begin to look like? At the risk of sounding very critical, clubs arent taking it nearly seriously enough, says Dr Madeleine Orr, an ecologist who has written extensively on sport and climate breakdown. Its the norm for teams to take flights to games that could be travelled in three hours on land. Many are doubtful that there will be any kind of regulation coming from the Premier League or the FA any time soon, and I would tend to agree because theres been no evidence of serious concern at that level. Unlike the EFL, the Premier League isnt even taking part in Green Football Weekend. Its environmental sustainability strategy, scheduled to launch in 2022, is yet to materialise. And while it has its own goals  halving emissions by 2030, going net zero by 2040  perhaps the reason it has been so taciturn on the subject is the sort of questions it might invite. Questions about short-haul flights. About its official oil partner. About airline sponsorships, cryptocurrency partnerships, clubs funded by some of the worlds biggest fossil fuel producers. Awkward questions. Organisations that simultaneously talk a big talk on climate while supporting or propping up highly extractive industries are hypocritical, says Dr Orr. If a club promotes their green sports day, or their bike-to-the-match programme, or vegan food at the stadium, and then I arrive and theres adverts for an airline or an oil company, Im put off. There needs to be authenticity in the messaging. And for the most part, fans expect their clubs to get on board with environmental action. Naturally individual clubs will point to their own initiatives. Arsenal offer fans their own green energy tariff. Manchester City have a club car-sharing scheme. Liverpool have planted some hedges at their academy. And yet individual actions are by definition just that. Virtually every expert on the issue agrees that tackling the climate emergency requires a huge coordinated effort: across national and local government, business and community enterprises, big corporations and private individuals. It requires, in short, the one thing at which football has proven itself over many years to be utterly useless. My personal view is that we need an independent regulator, says Rob Angus, Swindons chief executive. Football managing itself isnt the right direction. The EFL are trying. But having some standards and expectations that are joined up through the pyramid, from the Premier League down, should be an important part of the future of the game.",

Football French giant Paris Saint-Germain experienced a setback at the beginning of February when the teams star striker the bump he received turned out to be a thigh injury. Mbapp, who injured himself in Wednesdays win over Montpellier, will be sidelined for about three weeks. The French Comet will therefore not be seen in the first quarter-final match of the Champions League between PSG and Bayern Munich on February 14. Mbapp, 24, has played 26 matches in a PSG shirt this season and scored 25 goals. The strikers recovery forecast for the second leg between PSG and Bayern is encouraging, as the teams will play the second leg on March 8 in Munich. Chasing their first Champions League victory, PSG fell out of the competition in the quarterfinals last season, while Real Madrid came from a two-goal deficit to reach the quarterfinals. #Football #PSG #lost #Mbapp #illness #Champions #League #match #missed",
